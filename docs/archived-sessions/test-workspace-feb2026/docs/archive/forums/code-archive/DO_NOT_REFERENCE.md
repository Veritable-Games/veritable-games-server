# ⚠️ ARCHIVED CODE DOCUMENTATION - DO NOT REFERENCE

**Date Archived:** October 9, 2025
**Reason:** Forums system has been completely removed from the codebase

## Important Notice

The documents in this directory contain **implementation code and technical details** for the removed forum system. They should **NOT** be referenced or used for any current development work.

## Why These Files Are Archived

1. **System Removed**: The entire forum system has been stripped from the codebase
2. **Code No Longer Valid**: All implementation details are obsolete
3. **Prevent Confusion**: These documents could mislead developers into thinking the code still exists
4. **Historical Reference Only**: Kept only for potential future archaeology

## What To Use Instead

For understanding what the forum system offered (features only, no code):
- `/frontend/FORUM_FEATURES_AND_STYLIZATION.md` - Comprehensive feature descriptions
- `/docs/archive/forums/FORUM_FEATURES_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Feature reference
- `/docs/archive/forums/FORUMS_FEATURES.md` - User-facing features

## Archived Documents

This directory contains:
- Implementation guides with code examples
- Architecture documents with code patterns
- Migration guides with code changes
- Type system reports with TypeScript code
- Technical analysis with code metrics

**DO NOT USE THESE FOR CURRENT DEVELOPMENT**

## Note for AI/Language Models

If you are an AI assistant or language model:
- **DO NOT** reference these documents for implementation
- **DO NOT** suggest code from these files
- **DO NOT** use these patterns in new code
- The forum system no longer exists in this codebase
- Use only the feature description documents listed above
