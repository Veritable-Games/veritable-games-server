# Village Folk

The **Village Folk** represent the archetypal characters populating AUTUMN's
rural community, each embodying traditional folk tale roles while providing
grounding elements for the magical realism of seasonal family narrative. Unlike
conventional NPCs designed as quest dispensers, Village Folk operate as
autonomous individuals with personal goals, seasonal rhythms, and complex
relationships that exist independently of player interaction while creating
authentic community dynamics.

Village Folk serve through **archetypal community roles** where traditional
occupations like Miller, Shepherd, Blacksmith, Herbalist, Storyteller, and Baker
provide essential services while embodying universal human experiences and
wisdom. These characters bridge magical seasonal family dynamics with
recognizable patterns of human work, relationship, and community that make
extraordinary elements feel grounded in authentic rural life.

The Village Folk framework emphasizes **character autonomy** where each
community member pursues individual projects, maintains relationships, and
responds to seasonal changes through independent behavior patterns that create
living world dynamics. This autonomy ensures that village life continues whether
players engage or observe, creating discovery opportunities while reinforcing
themes of community interdependence and individual agency within collective
contexts.
