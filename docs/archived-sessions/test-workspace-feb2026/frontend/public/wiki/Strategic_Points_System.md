# Strategic Points System

The **Strategic Points System** represents ON COMMAND's core tactical
positioning framework that enables sophisticated battlefield control through
designated locations where squad members execute combat maneuvers, defensive
operations, and tactical coordination. Unlike traditional waypoint systems that
simply move units between locations, Strategic Points create dynamic tactical
environments where position quality, environmental factors, and enemy adaptation
combine to create emergent tactical situations requiring constant strategic
reassessment.

Strategic Points operate through **conditional activation frameworks** where
squad members respond to battlefield triggers, enemy movements, and tactical
opportunities through pre-planned positioning that reduces micromanagement while
maintaining tactical depth. This system enables complex multi-phase operations
through layered SP assignments that activate based on mission progression, enemy
behavior, and tactical necessity rather than requiring constant manual
repositioning.

The SP framework emphasizes **environmental integration** where position
effectiveness depends on cover quality, sight lines, elevation advantage, and
escape route availability that transforms simple positioning into sophisticated
tactical planning. The system rewards battlefield analysis and environmental
understanding while creating tactical variety through diverse terrain
utilization and adaptive positioning strategies that prevent repetitive tactical
solutions.

blind spot vulnerability that affects position offensive and defensive
effectiveness. Sight analysis creates tactical trade-offs while demonstrating
realistic combat considerations through visibility assessment and engagement
range optimization.

**Escape Route Availability** identifies withdrawal paths, flanking
vulnerability, and reinforcement accessibility that affects position
sustainability during extended engagements. Route availability creates tactical
resilience while preventing position traps through mobility preservation and
tactical flexibility maintenance.

**Environmental Hazard Integration** accounts for explosive barrels, unstable
structures, and environmental dangers that affect position safety and tactical
value. Hazard integration creates battlefield complexity while rewarding
environmental awareness through danger recognition and tactical adaptation.

## Tactical Maneuver Coordination

### Overwatch Position Systems

**Suppressive Fire Zones** establish areas of enemy movement denial through
elevated positions with superior sight lines and defensive advantage.
Suppressive zones create battlefield control while enabling defensive tactics
through area denial and enemy movement restriction.

**Mutual Support Networks** coordinate multiple overwatch positions for
overlapping coverage that prevents enemy flanking and ensures comprehensive
battlefield observation. Support networks create defensive depth while rewarding
coordinated positioning through enhanced tactical security and enemy engagement
efficiency.

**Rotation Protocols** alternate overwatch positions to prevent enemy adaptation
and maintain suppressive effectiveness through unpredictable defensive
positioning. Rotation protocols create tactical dynamism while preventing static
defense vulnerability through position variation and tactical unpredictability.

**Counter-Sniper Positioning** establishes specialized overwatch positions for
eliminating enemy precision threats through superior positioning and tactical
patience. Counter-sniper systems create tactical specialization while addressing
specific enemy capabilities through targeted tactical response and threat
neutralization.

### Advance Position Framework

**Assault Staging Areas** designate forward positions for coordinating
breakthrough operations through concentrated force application and tactical
momentum. Staging areas create offensive capability while enabling aggressive
tactics through organized assault preparation and coordinated advancement.

**Leap-Frog Advancement** coordinates sequential position occupation for
maintaining tactical momentum while preserving squad security through mutual
coverage. Leap-frog systems create sustainable offense while preventing reckless
advancement through systematic progression and continuous support.

**Breach Point Positions** establish positions for explosive entry, door
breaching, and fortification assault through specialized equipment deployment
and tactical coordination. Breach positions create tactical options while
enabling structure assault through focused entry preparation and coordinated
penetration.

**Consolidation Positions** designate defensive positions following successful
advancement for securing gained ground and preparing continued operations.
Consolidation positions create tactical sustainability while preventing
counter-attack vulnerability through defensive preparation and position
fortification.

## Conditional Activation Systems

### Trigger-Based Deployment

**Enemy Movement Triggers** activate position changes based on ACP force
positioning, creating responsive tactics that adapt to enemy behavior patterns.
Movement triggers create tactical responsiveness while reducing micromanagement
through automated tactical adjustment and intelligent position selection.

**Time-Based Activation** deploys positions according to mission timers,
creating phased tactical operations that evolve through predetermined tactical
progression. Time activation creates operational rhythm while enabling complex
multi-phase tactics through synchronized position deployment and coordinated
tactical evolution.

**Objective Completion Triggers** activate new positions following mission
milestone achievement, creating tactical progression that reflects operational
advancement. Completion triggers create tactical flow while maintaining mission
focus through objective-linked positioning and strategic progression.

**Emergency Activation Protocols** deploy fallback positions during tactical
crisis including squad member injury, overwhelming opposition, and position
compromise. Emergency protocols create tactical resilience while preventing
tactical collapse through automated crisis response and defensive position
activation.

### Environmental Response Adaptation

**Weather Condition Adjustment** modifies position effectiveness based on
visibility, movement difficulty, and equipment functionality during adverse
weather. Weather adjustment creates tactical variety while demonstrating
environmental impact through condition-responsive tactics and adaptive
positioning.

**Destruction Response Systems** reassign positions following environmental
destruction including building collapse, explosion damage, and cover
elimination. Destruction response maintains tactical viability while creating
battlefield dynamism through position adaptation and tactical flexibility.

**Civilian Presence Protocols** adjust positioning to minimize civilian
casualties while maintaining tactical effectiveness through modified engagement
rules and position selection. Civilian protocols create ethical complexity while
