# Squad Command System

The **Squad Command System** in ON COMMAND establishes comprehensive tactical
control over a six-person specialist team through sophisticated coordination
mechanics that balance individual squad member autonomy with meaningful player
command authority. Unlike traditional squad games where AI teammates serve as
expendable resources, ON COMMAND creates genuine relationships between commander
and squad through personality systems, skill specialization, and autonomous
behavior that makes each squad member feel like a valued individual rather than
tactical unit.

The squad framework operates through **Strategic Points (SP) and Emplacement
Zones (EZ)** that provide tactical positioning and equipment deployment without
requiring micromanagement, creating strategic depth through planning rather than
reflexes. This system enables complex tactical operations while maintaining
accessibility through intuitive command interfaces that scale from simple
position orders to sophisticated multi-phase tactical coordination.

Squad command emphasizes **character preservation** where keeping squad members
alive becomes both tactical necessity and emotional investment through developed
relationships and irreplaceable expertise. The system creates genuine stakes
through permanent character loss possibilities while providing tools for
tactical success that reward careful planning over aggressive risk-taking or
sacrificial strategies.

## Six-Person Team Structure

### Core Squad Composition

**Commander Authority Framework** establishes the player as anonymous tactical
leader addressed through military titles while maintaining professional distance
that preserves command authority without personal identity. Commander anonymity
enables player projection while creating authentic military hierarchy through

availability without feeling arbitrary. Availability management creates roster
depth requirements while providing narrative justification for character absence
through believable personal circumstances.

**Relationship Network Effects** influence squad performance based on
interpersonal dynamics including friendships, conflicts, and professional
respect that develop through shared experiences. Network effects create social
complexity while rewarding consistent team composition through developed working
relationships and tactical coordination.

## Strategic Points System

### Tactical Positioning Framework

**Cover Assignment Mechanics** designate protected positions for squad members
during combat through Strategic Point placement that provides tactical advantage
without micromanagement. Cover mechanics create positioning strategy while
maintaining tactical flow through automated movement and intelligent position
selection.

**Overwatch Position Control** establishes suppressive fire zones and area
denial through elevated SP placement that controls enemy movement and provides
tactical superiority. Overwatch control creates defensive depth while rewarding
environmental analysis through superior position identification and tactical
patience.

**Advance Position Coordination** places forward SPs for assault operations and
aggressive tactical maneuvers that enable offensive momentum while maintaining
squad cohesion. Advance coordination supports aggressive tactics while requiring
careful timing and support coordination for successful breakthrough operations.

**Fallback Position Planning** establishes retreat routes and defensive
positions through rear SP designation that enables tactical withdrawal without
route panic. Fallback planning creates tactical resilience while demonstrating
professional military doctrine through organized retreat capability and
defensive depth.

### Dynamic Positioning Adaptation

**Multi-Point Assignment** enables assigning squad members to multiple SPs with
conditional activation based on tactical triggers and enemy behavior patterns.
Multi-point systems create tactical flexibility while reducing micromanagement
through intelligent automated responses to changing battlefield conditions.

**Environmental Factor Integration** modifies SP effectiveness based on cover
quality, sight lines, escape routes, and environmental hazards that affect
position value. Environmental integration creates tactical depth while rewarding
battlefield analysis through position quality assessment and adaptive tactical
planning.

**Enemy Behavior Response** adjusts squad positioning based on ACP force tactics
requiring constant tactical evaluation and position modification for continued
effectiveness. Behavior response creates dynamic combat while preventing static
tactical solutions through adaptive enemy AI and tactical evolution.

**Time Pressure Management** balances thorough SP planning with mission urgency
through preparation time limitations that create strategic tension without
overwhelming complexity. Time management creates tactical decisions while
maintaining mission momentum through planning efficiency requirements and
tactical prioritization.

## Emplacement Zone Framework

### Deployable Equipment Systems

**Defensive Emplacement Options** include barriers, automated turrets, and
shield generators that provide tactical advantage through area control and squad
protection. Defensive options create tactical variety while supporting different
playstyles through fortification emphasis or mobility preservation choices.

**Support Equipment Deployment** establishes medical stations, ammunition
resupply, and communication relays that sustain squad operations during extended
engagements. Support deployment ensures sustainability while requiring strategic
placement decisions that balance accessibility with protection requirements.

**Utility Deployable Integration** places sensors, decoys, and environmental
modification tools that expand tactical options beyond direct combat through
information and deception. Utility integration creates tactical creativity while
rewarding unconventional thinking through alternative solution availability and
tactical innovation.

**Offensive Installation Systems** deploy heavy weapons platforms, explosive
devices, and area denial systems that provide overwhelming firepower at tactical
locations. Offensive systems enable aggressive tactics while requiring careful
placement and timing for maximum effectiveness without friendly fire incidents.

### Engineer Specialization Advantages

**Enhanced Deployment Speed** reduces emplacement construction time through
Engineer expertise and specialized equipment that creates tactical tempo
advantages. Speed enhancement rewards Engineer inclusion while creating
time-sensitive tactical opportunities through rapid fortification or position
preparation.

**Third Arm Capability** enables simultaneous equipment operation and combat
participation through cybernetic enhancement that maximizes Engineer battlefield
contribution. Arm capability creates unique value while demonstrating
