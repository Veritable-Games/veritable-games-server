# Point Note System

The **Point Note System** represents a universal spatial information framework
that enables players to attach notes to objects in three-dimensional game worlds
while creating visual connections through UI point-lines. Unlike traditional
quest markers or objective lists, the Point Note System creates organic
information organization through player-driven notation that connects abstract
information to specific world locations, enabling complex information management
through spatial memory and visual association.

The system operates through **grid-based positioning** that eliminates floating
point errors while providing precise anchor points for note attachment, creating
consistent spatial reference across different hardware configurations. This
framework enables reliable note placement while supporting object snapping and
organized environment layout that maintains spatial coherence regardless of
world complexity or scale variations.

Point Note emphasizes **player agency** in information management where users
determine what information deserves recording, how notes connect to each other,
and what organizational schemes best support their playstyle. The system creates
emergent gameplay through information discovery and connection rather than
prescribed objective tracking, enabling diverse applications from strategic
planning to emotional memory recording across different game contexts.

traditional scrollbar interface that supports both mouse and keyboard control.
Scrollbar navigation creates familiarity while enabling rapid traversal through
extensive note databases.

**Scroll Wheel Support** enables quick note cycling through mouse wheel input
that maintains spatial context while browsing information. Wheel support creates
efficiency while supporting natural interaction through standard input devices.

**Auto-Indexing Dictionary** automatically categorizes and indexes notes through
content analysis and relationship mapping that creates searchable databases.
Auto-indexing reduces overhead while ensuring discoverability through
intelligent categorization and tagging.

**Search and Filter Tools** enable targeted information retrieval through
keyword search, category filters, and relationship queries that surface relevant
notes. Search tools create accessibility while supporting complex information
management through powerful query systems.

### Organizational Features
