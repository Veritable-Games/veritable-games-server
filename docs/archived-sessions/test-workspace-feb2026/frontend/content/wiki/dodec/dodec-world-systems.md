# DODEC World Systems

## Planet Chione - The Super Earth

### Planetary Specifications

- **Scale**: 100 times the size of Earth with proportionally scaled gravity and
  atmosphere
- **Ocean Coverage**: Endless ocean so dense and deep that no probe has survived
  its depths
- **Atmospheric Density**: Increases with planetary mass, creating unique
  environmental conditions
- **Timeline**: 500,000 years removed from human origin system

### Celestial Bodies

**Three Moons**:

- **Arcturus**: Primary moon influencing tidal systems
- **Boreas**: Militarized moon housing Grand Voss (Allied Civil Preserve)
- **Dionysus**: Third moon in the celestial configuration

### Planetary Ring System

- **Dual Rings**: Two immense planetary rings encircling Chione
- **Support Structure**: Maintained by 16 Atlas Tethers using ocean energy and
  hidden reserves
- **Centrifugal Zones**: Each ring contains centrifugal zones for structural
  stability
- **Accessibility**: Rings remain inaccessible to surface populations, interiors
  mysterious

## Atlas Tether Infrastructure

### Megastructure Specifications

- **Quantity**: 16 towering structures aligned across planetary axis
- **Function**: Active support structures preventing energy/chemistry loss from
  atmosphere
- **Variations**: Each tether differs in humidity, temperature, and physical
  size
- **Water Systems**: Encircled by continuous fresh water waterfalls for power
  generation
- **Energy Source**: Utilize oceanic power and hidden planetary energy reserves

### Tether Cities and Settlements

**Primary Locations**:

- **Maria**: Northern Atlas Tether settlement with optimal human habitats
- **West-Town**: Directional city section scaling in multiple dimensions
- **Grand Voss**: Militarized settlement on moon Boreas (ACP stronghold)

## Arcology Architecture

### Structural Design Philosophy

- **Vertical Integration**: Sprawling cities scaling upward toward the heavens
- **Self-Containment**: Everything inhabitants need provided within walls
- **Interconnectivity**: Lifts, platforms, walkways, vistas, pathways, and
  bridges
- **Sustainability**: Designed for efficient, sustainable living patterns

### Transportation Infrastructure

**Vertical Mobility**:

- **Hand-held High Scalers**: Rapid upward mobility devices
- **Lift Systems**: Traditional elevator networks
- **Stairway Networks**: Winding stairs connecting all levels

**Horizontal Connectivity**:

- **Walkways**: Primary pedestrian thoroughfares
- **Platforms**: Multi-level connection points
- **Bridges**: Spanning connections between structures

### Environmental Integration

- **Plant Integration**: Trees and vegetation growing alongside walkways
- **Natural Lighting**: Structures designed to maximize natural illumination
- **Fresh Air Circulation**: Architecture promoting healthy air flow
- **Water Features**: Integrated water systems throughout living spaces

## Disappearing Stars Mystery

### Cosmic Crisis

- **Observable Phenomenon**: Night sky going dark, stars disappearing
- **Detection Method**: Only faint infrared observations remain
- **Sol Connection**: Earth's sun sends pulses with no discernible information
  patterns
- **System Muting**: Original planetary system being "muted" in visible spectrum

### Implications for Humanity

- **Preservation Urgency**: Must carry star names through oral tradition
- **Historical Documentation**: Protecting stellar knowledge through
  storytelling
- **Future Uncertainty**: Concerns about fate of original solar system
- **Scientific Investigation**: Stellan city research into cosmic phenomenon

## Transportation Networks

### Aerial Transport

- **Dirigibles**: Large-scale passenger transport
- **Hot Air Balloons**: Personal and recreational travel
- **Hang Gliders**: Individual mobility and recreation
- **Parachutes**: Emergency and specialized transport

### Ground-Based Systems

- **Trolleys**: Urban mass transit
- **Bullet Trains**: High-speed inter-city connections
- **Ziplines**: Quick urban traversal

### Energy Infrastructure

- **Solar Collectors**: Primary renewable energy capture
- **Thermal Converters**: Heat-to-energy conversion systems
- **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)**: Nuclear power for high-demand areas
- **Hydroelectric Storage**: Ocean-powered energy systems
- **Solid-State Batteries**: Advanced energy storage
- **Pulley Battery Systems**: Kinetic-to-potential energy conversion

This comprehensive world system supports post-war reconstruction focused on
community building, academic specialization, and sustainable technology
integration.
