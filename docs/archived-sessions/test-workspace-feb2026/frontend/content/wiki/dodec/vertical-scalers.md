# Vertical Scalers

**Vertical Scalers** are personal mobility equipment in DODEC communities,
providing foot and hand-mounted pulley systems that enable efficient movement
throughout the multi-level urban settlements built around Atlas Tether
foundations, eliminating the need for extensive stairway construction at every
access point within human-scale vertical cities.

## Equipment Overview

### Design Philosophy

Vertical Scalers represent the DODEC-era approach to **adaptive urban
navigation**, recognizing that the vertical city structures built around Atlas
Tether foundations require efficient personal mobility solutions. Rather than
constructing staircases throughout every level of vertical urban development,
personal equipment enables community members to navigate between city levels
efficiently.
