# Repair Tools

**Repair Tools** represent the essential equipment systems that enable DODEC
communities to maintain, restore, and enhance their Atlas Tether infrastructure
and community systems through collaborative maintenance practices and
distributed technical knowledge.

## Overview

In the post-war DODEC era, **community-centered maintenance philosophy** has
replaced centralized Imperial repair systems. Repair Tools embody this shift
toward **distributed technical capability**, where communities develop local
expertise and maintain shared tool systems that enable collective care for Atlas
