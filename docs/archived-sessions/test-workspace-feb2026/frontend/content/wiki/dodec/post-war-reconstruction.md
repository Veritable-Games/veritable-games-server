# Post-War Reconstruction

**Post-War Reconstruction** represents the transitional period following major
conflicts in the Veritable Games universe, particularly the shift from ON
COMMAND's military resistance to DODEC's peaceful community building.

## Historical Context

### End of Military Conflict

Following the conclusion of ON COMMAND's military resistance operations,
survivors faced the challenge of rebuilding society and establishing sustainable
communities.

### Transition Challenges

- **Infrastructure Rebuilding**: Reconstruction of damaged civilian and military
  infrastructure
- **Community Formation**: Establishment of new social structures and governance
  systems
- **Resource Management**: Allocation of limited resources for reconstruction
  efforts
- **Technology Integration**: Adaptation of military technologies for civilian
  reconstruction purposes

## Reconstruction Elements

### Community Building

- **[[dodec-community-characters|Community Formation]]**: Development of
  peaceful residential communities
- **[[atlas-tether|Infrastructure Development]]**: Integration of Atlas Tether
  technology for community support
- **Social Rehabilitation**: Healing and recovery from wartime trauma and
  violence

### Technology Adaptation

- **Military to Civilian**: Conversion of ON COMMAND military equipment for
  reconstruction purposes
- **[[on-command-character-classes|Unit Specialization]]**: Former military
  specialists adapting skills for reconstruction work
- **Resource Distribution**: Development of systems for equitable resource
  allocation

### Environmental Restoration

- **Ecological Recovery**: Restoration of environments damaged during military
  conflicts
- **Sustainable Development**: Implementation of environmentally conscious
  reconstruction practices
- **Community Infrastructure**: Development of sustainable living systems and
  support networks

## Integration with Other Systems

### ON COMMAND Legacy

Post-war reconstruction draws heavily on organizational and technological
developments from ON COMMAND military operations:

- **[[on-command-character-classes|Military Expertise]]**: Former specialists
  contributing reconstruction skills
- **[[allied-civil-preserve-territory|Territorial Management]]**: Adaptation of
  ACP territorial control for civilian governance
- **Equipment Conversion**: Military equipment repurposed for reconstruction
  activities

### DODEC Implementation

The DODEC project represents successful post-war reconstruction:

- **[[dodec-community-characters|Community Success]]**: Examples of successful
  post-war community building
- **[[planet-chione|Environmental Integration]]**: Reconstruction adapted to
  super-Earth environmental conditions
- **[[dodec-maintenance-sentinel|Maintenance Systems]]**: Automated systems
  supporting long-term community sustainability
