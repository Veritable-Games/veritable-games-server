# Modular Components System

The **Modular Components System** enables The Maintenance Sentinel's
transformation between bipedal and wheeled configurations, representing DODEC's
philosophy of adaptive technology serving community needs.

## System Overview

The modular system reflects **post-scarcity design principles** where technology
adapts to user needs rather than forcing users to adapt to technological
limitations.

## Core Components

### Manipulation Systems

- **Precision Tools**: Fine-motor capability for detailed maintenance and repair
  work
- **Heavy Lifting**: High-strength configurations for construction and major
  repairs
