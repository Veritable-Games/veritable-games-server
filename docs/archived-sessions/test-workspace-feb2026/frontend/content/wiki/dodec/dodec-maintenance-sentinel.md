# The Maintenance Sentinel - DODEC Player Character

## Character Overview

### Basic Description

**Semi-Autonomous Maintenance Machine**:

- **Physical Build**: Weighty, cumbersome machine of cheap iron construction
- **Scale**: Tall, lumbering presence in comparatively less-dense cityscape
  environments
- **Origin**: Repurposed from ancient war machines into utility and mechanical
  helper
- **Function**: Infrastructure maintenance and community assistance across Atlas
  Tether settlements

### Modular Design Capabilities

**Adaptive Form System**:

- **Bipedal Mode**: Standard humanoid configuration for community interaction
  and detailed work
- **Wheeled Mode**: Rolling configuration for efficient transportation and heavy
  lifting
- **Form Transformation**: Can morph between different configurations based on
  task requirements
- **Edict Evolution**: Late-game transformation into crystalline, abstract
  machine species native to Grand Voss

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Environmental Interaction

**Weight and Impact Systems**:

- **Heavy Presence**: Movement causes environmental reactions - shaking
  floorboards, dust clouds, reverberating sounds
- **Destructive Potential**: Can damage fragile items, bookshelves, dishes, and
  light furnishings if careless
- **Careful Movement**: Costs resources but prevents destruction, requires
  strategic consideration
- **Community Response**: NPCs can use "off switch" if player causes too much
  disruption

### Physics-Based Gameplay

**System-Driven Interactions**:

- **Object Physics**: World reacts through collision states, mass, velocity, and
  force calculations
- **Environmental Feedback**: Objects creak, groan, snap based on physical
  interaction variables
- **Dynamic Response**: Glass pots shake, plants sway, damaged boards groan
  based on player movement
- **Open-Ended Mechanics**: Physics and systems interaction rather than scripted
  animations

### Heat Management System

**Energy Regulation Mechanics**:

- **Periodic Cooling Required**: Vulnerable to overheating during extended
  activity
- **Resource Management**: Heat management affects gameplay decisions and
  strategic planning
- **Community Integration**: NPCs aware of machine's thermal needs and
  limitations
- **Environmental Factors**: Different Atlas Tether conditions affecting heat
  buildup and cooling needs

## Social Integration

### Community Recognition

**Historical Awareness**:

- **War Machine Heritage**: Community recognizes machine as something that "used
  to bring violence and war"
- **Peaceful Repurposing**: Now seen as mechanical helper serving community
  needs
- **Trust Building**: Demonstrates peaceful intent through careful movement and
  helpful actions
- **Cultural Integration**: Gradual acceptance as valuable community member
  despite imposing presence

### NPC Interaction Systems

**Communication and Control**:

- **Social Enacts**: Player can express socially-related concerns through
  dialogue system
- **Community Authority**: NPCs have ability to "switch off" player if too
  destructive
- **Protest Mechanisms**: Player can protest NPC control through expressive
  dialogue
- **Attention Requirement**: Must give characters attention in conversation for
  optimal interaction

### Conversation Priority

**Relationship Building**:

- **Character Agency**: NPCs maintain autonomy and can refuse player actions
- **Trust Development**: Respectful interaction builds positive community
  relationships
- **Communication Balance**: Player action must balance efficiency with social
  consideration
- **Community Integration**: Success requires consideration of community needs
  and social dynamics

## Task and Mission Framework

### Infrastructure Maintenance

**Primary Responsibilities**:

- **Skyward Utopia Maintenance**: Caring for vertical city infrastructure built
  in harmony with community
- **Accessibility Systems**: Maintaining pulleys, walkways, and vertical scaling
  systems
- **Repair Operations**: Fixing broken infrastructure to maintain community
  accessibility standards
- **Community Consent**: Repartitioning and major repairs require community
  agreement

### Exploration and Discovery

**World Navigation**:

- **Atlas Tether Scaling**: Navigating exterior Atlas Tether structures using
  accessibility systems
- **Shortcut Discovery**: Finding efficient routes through complex vertical city
  environments
- **Mental Mapping**: Forming understanding of world through exploration and
  community interaction
- **Environmental Adaptation**: Learning to work effectively in diverse Atlas
  Tether conditions

## Advanced Systems

### Item Management

**Inventory and Carrying**:

- **Modular Carrying**: Two systems for carrying items - hands and under-arm
  storage
- **Item Rotation**: Can lift items to view and select for interaction prompts
- **Realistic Limitations**: Cannot carry infinite items, must manage carrying
  capacity strategically
- **Drop/Pickup Mechanics**: Must actively select items to drop or initiate
  interaction prompts

### Upgrade and Evolution

**Character Development**:

- **Skeletal Modularity**: Modular machine design enabling orthogonal variation
- **Player-Driven Variation**: Balance supporting multiple playstyles without
  single optimal approach
- **Edict Transformation**: Late-game evolution into crystalline abstract
  machine species
- **Enhanced Mobility**: Improved abilities including wall and floor bouncing
  for momentum

## Environmental Context

### Distant Future Setting

**Timeline Context**:

- **Post-War Period**: Long after ON COMMAND conflicts, wars forgotten by
  current population
- **Technology Integration**: Advanced technology seamlessly integrated into
  daily life
- **AI Assistance**: Artificial intelligence providing support without conscious
  awareness
- **Community Focus**: Society organized around mutual aid and collaborative
  problem-solving

### Atlas Tether Communities

**Settlement Characteristics**:

- **Sparse Networks**: Small communities scattered across diverse Atlas Tether
  environments
- **Environmental Diversity**: Each Tether offering unique habitability
  conditions
- **Citizen Science**: People pursuing specialized interests without formal
  expert hierarchy
- **Collaborative Culture**: Community values emphasizing cooperation and shared
  work

This player character represents the bridge between ancient wartime technology
and peaceful community service, embodying themes of redemption, careful
integration, and collaborative community building.
