# Stonebreaker Caste

The Stonebreaker Caste extracts raw materials from Grand Voss surface and
subsurface operations. They operate heavy mining equipment. They process raw
materials. They maintain extraction facilities. This caste faces the highest
mortality rates due to dangerous working conditions.

## Overview

Stonebreakers form the bottom tier of Grand Voss society. Imperial
administration assigns them the most dangerous extraction work. They mine lunar
resources from deep shafts and surface operations. Their work supports all Atlas
Tether construction and facility maintenance.

Stonebreaker life expectancy averages 15 years from assignment. Equipment
failures, cave-ins, toxic exposure, and industrial accidents cause most deaths.
Imperial policy considers Stonebreakers expendable for resource extraction
needs.

## Work Assignments

Stonebreakers handle multiple extraction operations across Grand Voss. Deep
shaft mining extracts rare minerals from unstable lunar geology. Surface
quarrying provides construction materials for Atlas Tether projects. Processing
facilities refine raw materials for Imperial use.

Work shifts last 16 hours with 8-hour rest periods. Teams work continuous
operations with no rest days. Production quotas increase monthly regardless of
safety conditions or equipment status.

## Training and Equipment

Stonebreaker training focuses on equipment operation and basic safety protocols.
Training lasts two weeks before assignment to active extraction sites. Workers
learn heavy machinery operation, material processing, and emergency procedures.

Equipment includes mining suits, extraction tools, and basic safety gear.
Imperial administration provides minimal protective equipment. Workers modify
equipment for better protection when possible. Equipment failures often result
in worker injuries or deaths.

## Living Conditions

Stonebreakers live in housing closest to extraction sites. Living quarters
consist of dormitory barracks with minimal amenities. Each worker receives a
bunk, storage locker, and shared sanitation facilities.

Food allocation provides basic nutrition sufficient for work requirements.
Medical care covers only injuries that prevent work. No recreational facilities
or personal space exists in Stonebreaker housing.

## Health and Safety

Work-related injuries occur daily in Stonebreaker operations. Common injuries
include respiratory damage from mineral dust, crushing injuries from equipment,
chemical burns from processing, and radiation exposure from deep mining.

Imperial medical services treat only injuries that prevent work continuation.
Workers with permanent disabilities face caste reclassification to even lower
status or elimination. No long-term medical care exists for chronic conditions.

## Social Structure

Stonebreakers organize into work crews of 10-15 members. Crew leaders receive
minor privileges in exchange for maintaining production quotas. Inter-crew
competition for resources creates division within the caste.

Contact with other castes occurs only during material delivery or equipment
maintenance. Stonebreakers cannot enter other residential areas without
authorization. Unauthorized movement results in punishment or elimination.

## Economic Function

Stonebreaker extraction provides all raw materials for Grand Voss operations.
Mining operations extract metals, minerals, and energy sources. Processing
facilities convert raw materials into usable forms for construction and
manufacturing.

Economic output from Stonebreaker labor exceeds their maintenance costs by
significant margins. Imperial administration maximizes extraction through
minimal resource allocation to worker welfare or safety improvements.

## Resistance and Control

Stonebreaker resistance takes forms of work slowdowns, equipment sabotage, and
information sharing with other castes. Imperial response includes punishment,
elimination of resistance leaders, and collective punishment of work crews.

Surveillance systems monitor all work areas and living quarters. Informant
networks reward workers for reporting resistance activities. Punishment ranges
from resource reduction to public execution as deterrent.

## Historical Development

The Stonebreaker Caste formed during post-Cascade Day resource shortages.
Initial mining operations used volunteer workers. Imperial administration made
assignments permanent and expanded operations through forced labor.

Early resistance to dangerous working conditions resulted in harsh enforcement
measures. Imperial forces eliminated union organizers and established
comprehensive workplace surveillance. The caste system stabilized through
combination of force and resource dependency.

## Contemporary Challenges

Resource extraction quotas increase despite declining equipment quality and
worker numbers. Geological instability creates more dangerous working
conditions. Equipment failures increase as maintenance resources go to
higher-priority Imperial projects.

Underground resistance networks attempt to organize across work crews. Some
workers share safety information and mutual aid despite surveillance. Imperial
response includes enhanced monitoring and collective punishment measures.

## Imperial Policy

Imperial doctrine frames Stonebreaker work as essential service to society and
state. Official education teaches that extraction work provides opportunity for
social contribution despite personal sacrifice.

Imperial propaganda emphasizes the honor of resource extraction and material
contribution to Imperial projects. The ideology obscures the exploitative nature
of dangerous work conditions and expendable worker treatment.

## Mortality and Replacement

Stonebreaker mortality rates require constant replacement from other castes and
new population processing. Workers who fail to meet quotas face caste demotion
to Stonebreaker status. Children of Stonebreakers automatically receive caste
assignment at age 15.

Mortality records show average service life of 15 years from assignment. Causes
of death include industrial accidents, respiratory failure, equipment crushing,
toxic exposure, and exhaustion. Imperial administration maintains replacement
rates to ensure continuous operation.
