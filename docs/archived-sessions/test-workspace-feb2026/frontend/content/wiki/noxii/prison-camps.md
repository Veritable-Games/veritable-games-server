# Prison Camps

**The prison camp system on Grand Voss transforms the former industrial
infrastructure into comprehensive detention facilities. These camps house the
entire civilian population under systematic control and surveillance. The
facility design prioritizes containment and labor extraction over human dignity
or rehabilitation.**

## Facility Overview

### Geographic Distribution

Grand Voss operates as a single massive detention complex divided into seventeen
district-based camps. Each district maintains specialized functions within the
overall detention system. The camps interconnect through controlled
transportation networks that prevent unauthorized movement between areas.

Central administrative facilities coordinate operations across all district
camps. Processing centers handle prisoner intake, classification, and assignment
distribution. Specialized detention areas isolate prisoners considered
high-security risks by facility management. Industrial zones provide work
assignments and maintain essential facility operations.

The physical layout exploits the original industrial design of Grand Voss.
Manufacturing buildings transformed into prisoner housing with minimal
modification for human habitation. Administrative centers became processing and
surveillance coordination facilities. Transportation networks converted to
prisoner movement control systems with checkpoints and monitoring.

### Population Capacity

Current prisoner population exceeds 2.3 million individuals housed across all
district camps. Original facility design accommodated this population as
voluntary workers rather than detained prisoners. Overcrowding creates
significant health and safety problems throughout the detention system.
Administrative expansion plans call for population reduction through transfer or
elimination rather than improved facilities.

Population density varies significantly between district camps based on housing
availability and security classification. Minimum security camps house workers
essential for facility maintenance and operation. Maximum security camps isolate
prisoners considered political threats or resistance risks. Medical camps
segregate prisoners with health conditions requiring specialized care or
quarantine.

## Camp Classification System

### Minimum Security Districts

Minimum security camps house prisoners with essential technical skills needed
for facility operation. These prisoners maintain power generation systems, water
treatment facilities, and communication networks. Housing conditions provide
marginally better accommodations and slightly increased personal autonomy.
Surveillance remains comprehensive but less overtly oppressive.

Work assignments in minimum security camps involve complex technical tasks
requiring specialized knowledge and training. Prisoners in these facilities
often include former engineering caste members and technical specialists.
Administrative trust remains limited but sufficient to allow unsupervised access
to critical infrastructure systems.

Movement restrictions apply but allow limited travel between work sites within
assigned districts. Communication monitoring continues but permits technical
coordination necessary for facility operations. Disciplinary measures emphasize
work assignment changes rather than physical punishment or resource restriction.

### Standard Security Districts

Standard security camps house the majority of the prison population in basic
detention conditions. These prisoners perform manual labor, food service,
cleaning, and basic maintenance tasks. Housing provides minimal accommodations
with significant overcrowding and limited privacy. Surveillance operates
comprehensively with frequent inspections and monitoring.

Work assignments focus on repetitive manual tasks that require minimal skill or
training. Prisoners maintain facility cleanliness, prepare and distribute food,
and perform basic repair work. Administrative oversight remains intensive with
productivity quotas and behavior compliance requirements.

Movement restrictions limit prisoners to assigned residential and work areas
within their designated district. Communication faces significant monitoring and
content restrictions. Disciplinary measures include resource reduction, work
assignment changes, and transfer to higher security facilities.

### Maximum Security Districts

Maximum security camps house prisoners classified as political threats or
resistance risks. These individuals face severe restrictions on movement,
communication, and personal autonomy. Housing conditions deliberately minimize
comfort and privacy to discourage political organization or resistance
activities.

Work assignments involve dangerous or unpleasant tasks designed as punishment
rather than productive labor. Prisoners may face isolation work assignments to
prevent communication with other detained individuals. Administrative attention
focuses on behavior monitoring and resistance activity detection.

Movement restrictions confine prisoners to designated areas with constant
supervision and escort requirements. Communication undergoes intensive
monitoring with severe penalties for unauthorized contact. Disciplinary measures
include solitary confinement, resource elimination, and transfer to specialized
punishment facilities.

### Medical Isolation Camps

Medical camps house prisoners with health conditions requiring specialized care
or quarantine from the general population. These facilities operate with medical
supervision but maintain detention security protocols. Treatment focuses on
maintaining prisoner survival rather than comprehensive healthcare or
rehabilitation.

Conditions in medical camps depend on the specific health issues being
addressed. Infectious disease quarantine areas maintain strict isolation
protocols. Mental health facilities provide minimal psychiatric care with
emphasis on behavioral control rather than treatment. Chronic illness areas
offer basic symptom management without curative care.

Medical personnel in these facilities include both prisoner healthcare workers
and external medical staff. Treatment decisions prioritize facility security and
cost management over patient welfare. Medical resources remain limited with
triage protocols that deny care for conditions deemed non-essential.

## Daily Operations

### Security Protocols

Security systems operate through multiple layers of surveillance and control
mechanisms. Automated monitoring systems track prisoner locations throughout
facility areas. Human security personnel provide immediate response to
compliance violations or emergency situations. Regular inspections maintain
control over prisoner possessions and living spaces.

Checkpoint systems control movement between different areas within each camp.
Prisoners require authorization and identification verification for any movement
outside assigned areas. Electronic monitoring tracks prisoner locations in
real-time through identification devices and surveillance networks. Security
alerts activate automatically for any unauthorized movement or activity.

Disciplinary protocols respond to compliance violations through escalating
punishment systems. Minor infractions result in resource restrictions or
additional work assignments. Major violations trigger isolation punishment or
transfer to higher security facilities. Resistance activities face severe
punishment including elimination for repeated offenses.

### Resource Management

Food distribution operates through centralized kitchens serving multiple camps
within each district. Meal planning provides minimal nutrition requirements
without consideration for dietary preferences or cultural needs. Preparation
involves prisoner labor under intensive supervision to prevent contamination or
resistance activities.

Water distribution relies on rationing systems that restrict individual
consumption to basic survival needs. Quality varies throughout the facility
depending on treatment system functionality and infrastructure condition. Hot
water remains limited to specific times and locations based on energy
availability and administrative priorities.

Medical supplies focus on emergency treatment and basic preventive care only.
Specialized medications or treatments require administrative approval with
significant bureaucratic delays. Mental health resources remain virtually
nonexistent throughout the detention system. Dental care provides emergency
procedures only without routine maintenance or preventive treatment.

### Labor Systems

Work assignments organize prisoners into production units that maintain facility
operations and provide basic services. Manufacturing ceased after the
transformation from industrial facility to detention center. Current labor
focuses on maintenance, food service, cleaning, and administrative support
tasks.

Productivity expectations remain minimal due to prisoner motivation problems and
limited resource availability. Quality control emphasizes compliance with
procedures rather than output effectiveness or efficiency. Innovation or
independent problem-solving receives discouragement to prevent development of
resistance capabilities.

Training programs provide basic skills needed for work assignments without
broader educational opportunities. Specialization remains limited to prevent
prisoners from developing valuable skills that could support independence or
resistance activities. Career advancement opportunities do not exist within the
detention labor system.

## Infrastructure Conditions

### Housing Facilities

Housing accommodations provide minimal space and amenities for basic survival
needs only. Multiple prisoners share rooms originally designed for individual
occupancy. Privacy remains nonexistent due to overcrowding and surveillance
requirements. Personal storage consists of small assigned areas with frequent
inspection and potential confiscation.

Building maintenance focuses on essential systems only with minimal attention to
comfort or safety improvements. Heating and cooling operate at minimal levels to
conserve energy resources. Lighting provides basic illumination without
consideration for personal preferences or activities. Ventilation systems
operate inadequately due to overcrowding and maintenance limitations.

Sanitation facilities serve multiple prisoners with limited privacy and
inadequate cleaning supplies. Plumbing systems experience frequent failures due
to overcrowding and minimal maintenance resources. Waste management systems
operate at capacity limits with regular overflow and sanitation problems. Pest
control remains minimal throughout housing areas.

### Infrastructure Decay

The transformation from industrial facility to detention center created
maintenance challenges that continue worsening over time. Original systems
designed for manufacturing operations cannot adequately support the current
population density and usage patterns. Repair resources focus on critical
systems only with deferred maintenance on less essential infrastructure.

Power generation systems operate with frequent failures and reduced capacity due
to aging equipment and minimal maintenance. Communication networks suffer from
equipment failures and limited replacement part availability. Transportation
systems deteriorate without adequate maintenance resources or replacement
vehicle availability.

Environmental systems struggle to maintain air quality and temperature control
with overcrowded conditions and aging equipment. Water treatment facilities
operate at maximum capacity with frequent system failures. Waste management
systems exceed design capacity with environmental contamination problems
throughout the facility.

## Resistance and Control

### Surveillance Systems

Comprehensive surveillance networks monitor prisoner activities throughout all
camp facilities. Video monitoring covers public areas with limited privacy
exceptions. Audio monitoring records conversations in common areas and selected
private spaces. Electronic tracking systems monitor prisoner locations through
identification devices and checkpoint systems.

Information gathering involves prisoner informants who report on suspicious
activities or resistance discussions. Administrative personnel analyze
surveillance data to identify potential security threats or resistance
organization. Communication monitoring intercepts and analyzes prisoner
correspondence and conversation content.

Counter-resistance activities involve disruption of prisoner organization
attempts and elimination of identified resistance leaders. Isolation tactics
prevent communication between potential resistance organizers. Disciplinary
measures discourage resistance activities through severe punishment and resource
restriction.

### Prisoner Responses

Passive resistance occurs through work slowdowns and minimal compliance with
facility regulations. Prisoners develop covert communication methods to share
information and maintain social connections. Small acts of defiance provide
psychological resistance while remaining within acceptable risk parameters.

Active resistance attempts face severe punishment but continue among certain
prisoner populations. Sabotage activities target facility infrastructure and
operations when opportunities arise. Escape attempts remain rare due to
comprehensive security measures and geographic isolation.

Collaboration with facility administration provides improved conditions for
cooperative prisoners. Information sharing about resistance activities offers
protection and resource advantages. Long-term adaptation strategies focus on
survival rather than resistance or liberation efforts.
