# Grand Voss

## Overview

Grand Voss is an industrialized moon serving as the primary administrative
center for Imperial operations within the Allied Civil Preserve territorial
network. The moon houses extensive mining operations, vertical cities, and the
incomplete Atlas Tether infrastructure system that dominates its equatorial
region. Grand Voss evolved from colonial mining operations into the central
Imperial facility following the Atlas Tether construction project and subsequent
infrastructure failures.

The moon's surface features vertical urban development concentrated around Atlas
Tether anchor points, with residential districts organized according to Imperial
caste classifications. Industrial operations extract lunar resources through
automated mining systems, while atmospheric processors maintain habitability
within enclosed urban zones. The moon's unique electromagnetic environment,
generated by the incomplete Atlas Tether network, requires specialized equipment
and creates distinct physiological effects on long-term residents.

Grand Voss operates under direct Imperial administration through the Allied
Civil Preserve framework, with all major systems controlled by Imperial
personnel and overseen by the Supreme Administrative Coordinator. The moon's
primary functions include resource extraction, administrative coordination, and
community programming activities centered around the competitive rehabilitation
system known as the Games.

## Geographic and Environmental Features

Grand Voss measures approximately 3,474 kilometers in diameter with a mass
roughly one-sixth that of Earth, creating gravitational conditions that enable
the construction of vertical cities and tower structures. The moon's surface
consists primarily of basaltic rock formations and mineral deposits essential
for Atlas Tether construction materials. Surface temperature varies dramatically
between -173°C in shadowed regions and 127°C in direct solar exposure, requiring
enclosed atmospheric systems for human habitation.

The equatorial region contains 87 completed Atlas Tethers, massive vertical
structures extending up to 2,000 kilometers from the surface toward orbital
space. These installations create powerful electromagnetic fields that permeate
the moon's atmosphere, producing measurable effects on electronic equipment and
human physiology. Residents experience metallic taste, dental vibration from
metal fillings, and persistent low-frequency resonance affecting chest cavity
tissue.

Vertical cities rise from the lunar surface in tower configurations, with
residential levels organized by Imperial caste assignments. The Crown Section
encompasses the administrative center built around the most stable cluster of
Atlas Tethers, while industrial districts occupy areas near mining operations
and resource processing facilities. Ring Graves mark impact sites where failed
Atlas Tether segments crashed to the surface, creating unique geological
formations now inhabited by scavenger communities.

## Atlas Tether Infrastructure System

The Atlas Tether network represents Grand Voss's most significant infrastructure
project, originally designed to support an orbital ring system encircling the
moon's equator. Of 240 planned installations, only 87 reached completion before
the Cascade event terminated construction. These massive structures anchor at
the lunar surface and extend toward orbital assembly points, utilizing
electromagnetic systems for structural support and transportation coordination.

Completed tethers vary in operational status, with 31 installations supporting
the Crown Section's partial ring segment spanning approximately 5,600
kilometers. This connected segment remains visible from the moon's surface as a
dark arc crossing the sky, with automated systems continuing maintenance
operations despite lacking complete structural integration. Individual tethers
throughout other districts stand without their intended ring connections,
creating isolated towers with varying degrees of structural integrity.

The electromagnetic fields generated by tether operations provide power
distribution throughout Grand Voss's urban centers while creating environmental
hazards requiring specialized safety protocols. Tether sickness affects
newcomers through electromagnetic exposure, causing vertigo and sensory
disruption that requires months of acclimatization. Children born on Grand Voss
develop enhanced electromagnetic sensitivity, enabling weather prediction
through harmonic detection and navigation via magnetic field awareness.
