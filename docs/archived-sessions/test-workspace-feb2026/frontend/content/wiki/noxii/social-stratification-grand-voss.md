# Social Stratification (Grand Voss)

Grand Voss society divides into strict castes after Cascade Day. The Imperial
government created these divisions to control the population. The system
organizes workers by Imperial need. It maintains clear hierarchies from
administrators to laborers.

## Administrative Overview

The Grand Voss classification system organizes people by function. Imperial
planners adapted these roles to Atlas Tether infrastructure conditions. The
formal Stonebreaker Classification shows Imperial commitment to resource
extraction. The framework distributes population across operational requirements
under administrative oversight.

## Personnel Classification Framework

### Engineering Classification

Engineers maintain Atlas Tether infrastructure and operational systems. They
provide technical services for death game facilities and urban scaffolding
operations. Their expertise requires high-security clearance for Atlas Tether
maintenance areas.

Engineers receive advanced technical training in vertical city systems. They
maintain electromagnetic systems, structural integrity monitoring, and orbital
coordination protocols. Most engineers live in restricted residential complexes
near Atlas Tether anchor points.

### Administrative Classification (Prefects)

Prefects handle bureaucratic functions and population management. They process
work assignments, resource allocation, and compliance monitoring. Prefects
coordinate between Imperial command and lower castes.

Administrative personnel receive training in Imperial protocols, population
management, and resource optimization. They maintain detailed records of caste
performance and compliance. Prefects live in administrative districts with
enhanced amenities.

### Labor Classification

Labor caste provides general maintenance and construction services. They handle
routine infrastructure maintenance, facility cleaning, and basic construction
tasks. Labor workers perform tasks too dangerous or degrading for higher castes.

Labor personnel receive minimal training focused on specific task performance.
They live in dense housing blocks near work sites. Work assignments change based
on Imperial facility needs.

### Stonebreaker Classification

Stonebreakers extract raw materials from Grand Voss surface and subsurface
operations. They operate heavy mining equipment, process raw materials, and
maintain extraction facilities. This caste faces the highest mortality rates due
to dangerous working conditions.

Stonebreaker training focuses on equipment operation and safety protocols. They
live in housing closest to extraction sites. Imperial policy considers
Stonebreakers expendable for resource extraction needs.

### Icebreaker Classification

Icebreakers manage communication and social interface between castes. They
process information flow, handle inter-caste coordination, and manage social
compliance monitoring. Icebreakers serve as the interface between Imperial
administration and the population.

Icebreaker training includes communication protocols, social monitoring
techniques, and compliance assessment. They maintain surveillance networks
across all residential areas. Icebreakers report social compliance issues to
administrative personnel.

## Caste Mobility and Assignment

Imperial policy prohibits movement between castes except through specific
administrative procedures. Caste assignment occurs at birth based on parental
caste status. Exceptional performance may result in classification review, but
approval requires multiple administrative levels.

Children receive caste-specific education from age five. Educational programs
prepare students for their predetermined roles. Imperial doctrine teaches that
caste assignment reflects individual capability and social contribution.

## Residential Segregation

Each caste lives in designated residential areas with different amenities and
security levels. Engineering and Administrative districts feature enhanced
amenities, larger living spaces, and better food allocation. Labor and
extraction castes receive minimal amenities with dense housing and basic
nutrition.

Residential areas include surveillance systems monitoring compliance with
Imperial protocols. Movement between districts requires authorization from
administrative personnel. Unauthorized movement results in punishment or caste
reclassification.

## Economic Function

The caste system optimizes resource extraction and infrastructure maintenance
for Imperial needs. Each caste performs specific economic functions essential
for Grand Voss operations. The system maximizes productivity while minimizing
resource allocation to non-essential population needs.

Caste specialization creates dependency relationships preventing organized
resistance. No single caste possesses complete knowledge or resources for
independent operation. This interdependence reinforces Imperial control through
systematic division of essential capabilities.

## Social Control Mechanisms

Imperial administration uses caste divisions to prevent unified resistance. Each
caste receives different privileges, creating competition rather than
cooperation between groups. Administrative policy encourages caste rivalry
through resource competition and preferential treatment.

Surveillance systems monitor inter-caste communication and social relationships.
Imperial doctrine promotes caste loyalty over broader social solidarity.
Punishment for unauthorized inter-caste organization includes caste
reclassification to lower status.

## Historical Development

The caste system developed during the post-Cascade Day emergency period. Initial
population organization responded to immediate survival needs. Imperial
administration formalized temporary arrangements into permanent social
structure.

Early resistance to caste implementation resulted in harsh enforcement measures.
Imperial forces eliminated resistance leaders and established comprehensive
surveillance. The system stabilized through combination of force and resource
dependency.

## Contemporary Challenges

The caste system faces ongoing challenges from underground resistance networks.
Some individuals attempt unauthorized caste mobility or cross-caste
organization. Imperial response includes enhanced surveillance and punishment
measures.

Resource scarcity creates tension within and between castes. Competition for
limited resources strains social stability. Imperial administration adjusts
caste privileges to maintain system balance while maximizing productivity.

## Imperial Ideology

Imperial doctrine justifies the caste system as natural social organization
based on individual capability and social contribution. Official education
teaches that caste assignment reflects merit and social necessity.

Imperial propaganda emphasizes caste interdependence and mutual benefit. The
ideology obscures the exploitative nature of resource extraction and Imperial
control. Educational systems reinforce caste loyalty and Imperial authority.

## Enforcement Mechanisms

Imperial security forces maintain caste boundaries through surveillance,
punishment, and resource control. Administrative personnel monitor compliance
with caste regulations. Violations result in punishment ranging from resource
reduction to caste reclassification.

Security systems include electronic surveillance, informant networks, and
regular inspections. Imperial forces conduct periodic compliance audits across
all residential areas. The enforcement apparatus maintains social control
through constant monitoring and swift punishment.
