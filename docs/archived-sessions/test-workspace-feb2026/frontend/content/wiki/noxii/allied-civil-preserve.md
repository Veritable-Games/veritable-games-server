# Allied Civil Preserve

## Overview

The Allied Civil Preserve (ACP) is the governing body of Grand Voss. The
organization formed after the Atlas Tether infrastructure failure on Cascade
Day. It administers population management, resource distribution, and industrial
operations throughout the lunar facility. The ACP employs approximately 12,000
personnel across five departments.

The organization operates under emergency protocols established during the
infrastructure crisis. These protocols grant control over essential services,
population movement, and resource allocation. The ACP maintains headquarters in
Grand Voss's Crown Section. Regional offices operate in all major population
centers.

## Historical Formation

The Atlas Tether electromagnetic failure killed 47,000 Engineering Caste members
in seventeen minutes. Their neural implants fused during the cascade event.
Surviving engineers could not maintain life support systems while managing the
political chaos. Various factions attempted to seize infrastructure control.

The emergency response committee formed within hours of the cascade. It included
representatives from multiple castes and civilian organizations. Within eighteen
months, former Engineering administrators controlled the committee. These
administrators understood both technical requirements and political
opportunities.

The ACP recognized that infrastructure failure created unprecedented leverage.
Previous governments relied on consent or coercion. Post-Cascade authority
operated through necessity. Control of power, water, air, and communication gave
the ACP influence beyond traditional politics.

The consolidation process marginalized other potential leaders through technical
arguments. Administrators concentrated decision-making within their core group.
By year three, they formalized emergency powers into permanent structures. This
created the Allied Civil Preserve bureaucratic framework.

## Administrative Structure

The ACP consists of five departments:

**Infrastructure Management** oversees Atlas Tether maintenance, power
generation, atmospheric processing, and transportation. The department employs
3,200 engineers and technical specialists. Regional offices coordinate with
Engineering Caste representatives.

**Population Services** manages residential assignments, identity documentation,
health records, and civil registration. The department maintains databases for
all Grand Voss residents. Branch offices operate in each district. They process
1,200 administrative requests daily.

**Resource Coordination** distributes food, water, materials, and consumer
goods. The department operates 47 distribution centers. It maintains contracts
with mining operations, agricultural facilities, and manufacturing plants.
Allocation follows quarterly distribution protocols.

**Emergency Response** coordinates crisis management, disaster relief, and
security operations. The department maintains rapid response teams. Personnel
rotate through six-week duty cycles.

**External Affairs** manages orbital communications and information
distribution. The department operates transmission facilities. It maintains
archives of pre-Cascade governmental records.

## Personnel and Recruitment

ACP positions require application through Population Services offices.
Applicants undergo background verification, aptitude assessment, and political
evaluation. Entry positions require two years of documented civilian service.
Administrative roles require ACP certification.

Sixty-eight percent of employees come from families with pre-Cascade
governmental service. Recruitment targets individuals aged 25-40 with technical
or administrative experience. The organization maintains gender parity at 52%
male and 48% female.

Promotion occurs through annual cycles. Performance metrics include service
duration, compliance, incident reports, and recommendations. Department heads
serve five-year terms. The Central Administrative Council confirms appointments.

## Governance Functions

The ACP administers Grand Voss through the Administrative Code. This 3,400-page
document outlines procedures, obligations, and enforcement. The Code undergoes
annual revision. Changes require approval from three department heads.

Security Personnel enforce civil law through Emergency Response departments.
Officers investigate violations, maintain order, and execute warrants.
Administrative Tribunals process 400 cases monthly. ACP legal specialists staff
these tribunals.

All residents must update personal information annually at Population Services
offices. Registration includes biometric data, residential history, employment
records, and family associations. The database contains 2.4 million current
residents and 1.8 million deceased records.

## Resource Management

Resource Coordination controls essential distribution through weekly schedules.
These determine food rations, water allowances, and material allocations per
district. Industrial facilities receive priority based on production quotas.

Food dispensaries operate at 147 locations. Adults receive 2,100 calories daily
through protein supplements, grain, and processed vegetables. Children and
laborers receive increased allocations.

Water allocation provides 50 liters daily for personal use. Medical facilities,
food centers, and industry receive additional allowances. Recycling systems
process 94% of consumed water.

## Infrastructure Operations

The ACP maintains Grand Voss infrastructure through contracts and direct
management. Atlas Tether installations receive priority, consuming 34% of the
budget. Power generation operates at 67% capacity due to equipment
deterioration.

Transportation includes magnetic rail connecting districts, cargo vehicles for
distribution, and emergency evacuation craft. The ACP operates 1,200 vehicles
and maintains 89 kilometers of rail.

Communication networks use Atlas Tether electromagnetic systems. The ACP
maintains 14 transmission nodes and 340 relay stations. System capacity supports
100,000 simultaneous connections.

## Failed Imitation Projects

The ACP attempted to recreate Atlas Tether capabilities through conventional
engineering. The Phoenix Hydroelectric Network project constructed massive
facilities in northern polar regions. Underground ice reserves were melted and
channeled through turbines. The project consumed resources that could have
improved living conditions.

The Phoenix Network misunderstood Atlas Tether principles. Original tethers used
electromagnetic fields and space-based energy collection. Hydroelectric systems
relied on conventional mechanics inadequate for Grand Voss's needs. The
facilities generated insufficient power while requiring continuous maintenance.

Ground-based antenna arrays attempted electromagnetic field replication. These
installations consumed massive power while producing weak effects. Maintenance
costs exceeded benefits. The facilities were abandoned. Their ruins remain
visible in industrial districts.

These failures reinforced population dependence on existing systems. The ACP
presents failures as necessary experiments. The population accepts limited
resources for promised restoration. This justifies policies prioritizing control
over problem-solving.

## Caste Management

The ACP manages each caste through specific privileges and restrictions. This
prevents horizontal organization while extracting productivity. The system
transformed fluid pre-Cascade classes into rigid hierarchies. Advancement
requires ACP approval. Resistance results in status degradation.

The Labor Caste receives sufficient resources for productivity but not surplus
accumulation. Energy quotas provide work power while restricting communication
and manufacturing access. Housing separates potential organizers. Community
leaders depend on ACP approval.

The Icebreaker Caste maintains cultural autonomy in exchange for entertainment
services. The ACP encourages their cultural activities while restricting
technical resources. This prevents political organization while maintaining
morale functions.

The Engineering Caste receives professional privileges for maintenance focus
over innovation. Career advancement requires loyalty to ACP priorities.
Technical resources depend on accepting strategic assignments. The caste
transformed from technological leaders to isolated technicians.

The Stonebreaker pipeline converts dissidents into disposable labor. Prison
camps provide recruitment for extraction sites. Sentencing ensures steady
prisoner flows. The ACP presents this as "resource contribution" and
rehabilitation. Mortality rates ensure few survive to share experiences.

## Prison Camp Administration

The prison camp network removes dissidents while extracting economic value.
Facilities eliminate threats to authority through forced labor contracts. Camps
maintain legal procedure appearance while operating by disposal quotas.

Processing evaluates prisoners by labor potential rather than crime severity.
Those with specialized knowledge receive temporary Engineering assignments.
Their expertise is extracted before disposal assignment. Political organizers
face immediate high-mortality extraction assignment.

Camp administrators meet disposal targets while preventing resistance.
Performance evaluations measure target achievement and security maintenance.
Career advancement requires loyalty over prisoner welfare.

Medical protocols maintain productivity while ensuring disposal rates. Treatment
depends on remaining economic value. Prosthetic replacements enable continued
labor while causing pain. This prevents escape or resistance.

## Economic Administration

The ACP manages the economy through centralized planning. Production targets
establish monthly quotas for mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. The
organization issues Imperial Credits. Exchange rates are fixed by Resource
Coordination.

Employment assignments occur through Population Services matching skills with
requirements. The employment rate is 78% with 522,000 active positions.
Unemployment benefits provide subsistence rations and basic housing.

Commercial activity requires departmental licensing. The ACP issues 200 monthly
permits for retail, services, and contractors. Businesses operate under
regulatory oversight with quarterly reviews.

## Security Operations

Security Personnel maintain order throughout Grand Voss. Force strength includes
4,200 officers and 1,800 support staff. Divisions operate from 23 precinct
stations with holding facilities.

Surveillance monitors public areas through 12,000 cameras and electromagnetic
sensors. The monitoring center processes 3.2 million daily events through
automated analysis and human review.

Criminal procedures follow Administrative Code protocols. Violations classify as
infractions, regulatory violations, or security threats. Penalties range from
fines to competitive rehabilitation programs.

## Current Status

The ACP continues operating under Cascade emergency protocols. Infrastructure
deterioration increases maintenance requirements. Population growth of 1.3%
annually strains housing and services.

Administrative priorities include Atlas Tether stabilization, food production
expansion, and alternative power development. The Five-Year Plan allocates 400
million credits for upgrades and repairs.

Public campaigns emphasize civic responsibility and resource conservation.
Weekly broadcasts reach 89% of the population through mandatory viewing in
public spaces.
