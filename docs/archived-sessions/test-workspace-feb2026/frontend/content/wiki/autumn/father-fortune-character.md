teaching humanity about love, he has lost sight of his original purpose,
creating the central tension in the family dynamic.

but over centuries of mortal life, the specifics have faded from his memory. He
knows something important has been lost but cannot grasp what it was, leading to
a persistent sense of inadequacy.
