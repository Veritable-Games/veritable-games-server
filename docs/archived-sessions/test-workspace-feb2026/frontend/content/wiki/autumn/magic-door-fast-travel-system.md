<h1>Magic Door Fast Travel System</h1>
<p>The <strong>Magic Door Fast Travel System</strong> represents AUTUMN&#39;s unique approach to world navigation that prioritizes relationship development over geographical exploration, creating transportation mechanics that reward emotional investment and community connection rather than simple area discovery. These magical doors appear near character homes as environmental objects that provide selective access based on relationship depth and trust building.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional fast travel systems that unlock through area exploration or quest completion, AUTUMN&#39;s magic doors require <strong>relationship threshold achievement</strong> combined with location access from Autumn&#39;s home, ensuring that world navigation serves narrative progression and community integration rather than convenience alone. This system reinforces the game&#39;s core themes of family connection and community belonging through transportation mechanics.</p>
<p>The magic door framework integrates magical realism elements that enhance natural relationship processes without replacing them, creating transportation that feels earned through emotional investment while maintaining the game&#39;s grounded approach to human connection and community engagement. Doors serve as visible progress markers for relationship development while providing practical navigation benefits that support continued community participation.</p>
