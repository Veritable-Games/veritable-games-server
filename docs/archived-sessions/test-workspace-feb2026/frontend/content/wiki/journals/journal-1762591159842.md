Winter is the epitome of stoicism and resilience, often depicted as a cold and
isolated figure. Despite her introverted nature, she has a deeply caring nature
and is always willing to help those in need. She is a wise and insightful
figure, always willing to lend a sympathetic ear and offer sound advice. Her
struggle to maintain a balance between protecting her own independence and
showing vulnerability are an important part of her character arc.

Spring is the embodiment of hope and renewal, always looking towards the future
with an unbreakable optimism. She is a lively and energetic figure, but she can
also be reckless and impulsive. She is always willing to go above and beyond for
those she cares about, but she must learn to set boundaries and take care of
herself as well. Her struggle to find a balance between her endless hope and the
realities of the world are what drive her character arc.

Summer is the ultimate embodiment of abundance and growth, often depicted as a
warm and generous figure. Despite her selfless nature, she often forgets to take
care of herself, always putting the needs of others first. She is a wise and
compassionate figure, always willing to listen and offer support, but she must
learn to take care of herself as well. Her struggle to find a balance between
giving and receiving are an important part of her

One possible reason Autumn and Little may have for visiting Spring could be to
learn more about her. Given that Spring is the embodiment of renewal and growth,
she represents the potential for change and improvement. Autumn may feel that
spending time with Spring could give her a fresh perspective on her own
challenges and provide her with the inspiration she needs to keep pushing
forward.

Another factor that could motivate Autumn and Little to visit Spring is the
desire to help her. Winter may be struggling to make it through to the arrival
of Spring, and Spring's kindness and generosity may make her vulnerable to those
who seek to take advantage of her. If Autumn and Little were to witness someone
taking advantage of Spring, they may feel a sense of responsibility to step in
and help her. This could be a way for Autumn to make a positive impact on the
world and to fulfill her purpose as the embodiment of Autumn.

The journey to Spring may also be a way for Autumn and Little to take a break
from their own challenges and responsibilities, and a chance for them to connect
on a personal, emotional level. Spring's warmth and energy may be a welcome
contrast to Winter's cold isolation, and the journey to Spring could serve as a
way for Autumn and Little to find hope and inspiration in the midst of their
struggles.

It's possible that Autumn and Little could decide that Spring needs help without
witnessing someone taking advantage of her. They may have a hunch based on
Spring's behavior or demeanor, or they may simply sense that Spring is in need
of assistance. Whether or not they have solid evidence, Autumn and Little may
feel a strong sense of empathy towards Spring and be motivated to offer their
support and reassurance.
