"I love (love, love love) you" can mean, "I'm sorry"

The draw through much of the game is [being] [that] the character's HUB is
getting closer and closer to where the other stories are taking place; [reveal
spoilers] this other sort of characters are long — long gone from the structures
that remain once Autumn arrives. She lives an untold amount of time after the
abandonment of these cities.

How can the characters in Autumn be [so] magic[?] Where is this sense of 'light
fantasy' coming from?
