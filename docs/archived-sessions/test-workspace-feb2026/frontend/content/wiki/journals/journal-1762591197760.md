Creatures The forest dwelling creatures are quite bothered by the sudden turn of
events and will require assistance frequently. Unique personalities and
dispositions result in various levels of circumstantial urgency, emotional
responses, communication abilities, and detail observation. Creatures you
interact with are sentient, anthropomorphized, talking animals. Those whom you
do not interact with appear instinctive or primal. Basic Summary
