the seasons are causing havoc in the ~~sleepy~~ town of ether. Light magic,
bookkeeping, and narrative people have borrowed from the town library for
generations. some books staying unreturned for decades. The library became an
archive of things. Any item with limited use but wide appeal ranging to knick
knacks and near sci-fi gadgets. homely cottagecore

not 'punk' exploratory for contemporary behavior and motivation with a communal
worldview as a central theme

This game, Ico I'm playing it for the first or second time now. It's an
adventure 'puzzle' with very minimal combat frequent but not challenging. one
button all over again so many times to kill an enemy. you're invincible getting
knocked down is possible but you can knock your opponents dont stop

all of the common details aside. you have a companion character that can
activate certain doors between major puzzles. you sit down on a chair with her
to save. if you leave her behind she "gets carried off by the same enemies you
have combat encounters with too many details missing the forest for the trees.

I just want the side character to solve a puzzle. [have agency on her own] open
a door on her own or pull a lever on her own. Has no autonomy has to be called
to or dragged around by the hand. Does not speak no dialogue between these two.

we can dig deeper with critique!

the minute now is up to me
