The humans are not able to control the city's Architect, and weren't able to
reprogram it's subordinates for combat. They can't control these forces without
the city's integrated communication systems, so the creation of a new AI isn't
possible.

communicate with electrical impulses to convey messages and coordinate
instructions, relaying them through a designated controller.

The Architect's nanites are designed like an immune system and will fend off
competing variants. If humanity is able to create an AI more sophisticated than
the one in place (or a powerful foreign nanite is introduced) they could
potentially wipe out the old Architect's functions and assume control of the
city. Quickly repopulating it with the dominant AI. Nanites can adapt over
successive attacks, but this change makes them harder for other cities to
recognize. (code isn't synced between core AI) Those mutations set them apart
from one another over time until they become incompatible with one another. The
inhabitants' survival is dependant on the AI's ability to adapt to environments
and coded attacks. (very much like how natural selection operates)
