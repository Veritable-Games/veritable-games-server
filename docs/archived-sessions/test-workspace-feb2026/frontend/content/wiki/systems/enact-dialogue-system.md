<h1>Enact Dialogue System</h1>
<p>The <strong>Enact Dialogue System</strong> represents a revolutionary emotional conversation framework that implements twelve fundamental emotional forces through binary directional choices, creating authentic human emotional expression validated by extensive psychological research. Unlike traditional dialogue trees with predetermined responses, Enact enables genuine emotional communication through mathematical frameworks that generate over 1,512 distinct emotional expressions while maintaining interface simplicity through left/right (LT/RT) selection.</p>
<p>The system operates through <strong>emotional force dynamics</strong> where twelve core emotions including SEEKING, EMPATHY, CONTENTMENT, ELATION, SUFFERING, ASSERTION, OPPOSITION, FEAR, DISGUST, ANTICIPATION, ACCEPTANCE, and COMFORT interact through intensity modulation, temporal bias, and authenticity strain. This framework creates emergent emotional complexity from simple binary choices, enabling nuanced expression that reflects real human psychological processes rather than scripted responses.</p>
<p>Enact emphasizes <strong>psychological authenticity</strong> through mixed emotion processing where primary and secondary emotions blend at validated ratios, creating realistic emotional ambivalence and complexity. The system incorporates processing delays, authenticity strain from expressive dissonance, and resource exhaustion mechanics that create naturalistic conversation flow while preventing unlimited emotional cycling that characterizes traditional dialogue systems.</p>
<h2>Twelve Emotional Forces Framework</h2>
<h3>Core Emotional Forces</h3>
<p><strong>SEEKING</strong> represents approach drive toward desired objects, attention, or knowledge, creating conversational momentum through curiosity and desire for connection or information. Seeking drives exploration while providing natural conversation initiation through interest expression and engagement demonstration.</p>
<p><strong>EMPATHY</strong> enables understanding and reciprocating emotional energy through resonance with others&#39; emotional states, creating connection through shared feeling and mutual understanding. Empathy facilitates relationship building while demonstrating emotional intelligence through appropriate emotional response and support provision.</p>
<p><strong>CONTENTMENT</strong> expresses satisfaction, peace, and equilibrium states that communicate comfort with current circumstances and relationship dynamics. Contentment provides emotional baseline while enabling appreciation expression and stability communication through calm presence.</p>
<p><strong>ELATION</strong> manifests joy, excitement, and celebration through high-energy positive expression that shares happiness and creates emotional contagion. Elation enables enthusiasm communication while building positive relationship dynamics through shared celebration and excitement transmission.</p>
<p><strong>SUFFERING</strong> consolidates sadness and pain into distress expression seeking comfort, creating vulnerability through emotional need communication. Suffering enables support seeking while building intimacy through shared vulnerability and emotional authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>ASSERTION</strong> combines self-worth, principles, and courage into confident expression that establishes boundaries and communicates values. Assertion enables autonomy expression while creating respect through clear communication and principled stance taking.</p>
<h3>Opposition and Defensive Forces</h3>
<p><strong>OPPOSITION</strong> consolidates anger and defensive response into rejection and boundary-setting that protects emotional space and communicates disagreement. Opposition enables conflict navigation while maintaining relationship integrity through clear boundary communication and defensive positioning.</p>
<p><strong>FEAR</strong> expresses vulnerability and uncertainty while seeking reassurance, creating connection through shared concern and support seeking. Fear enables threat communication while building trust through vulnerability expression and protection seeking.</p>
<p><strong>DISGUST</strong> communicates moral or physical revulsion through contamination rejection that establishes value boundaries and ethical positions. Disgust enables moral communication while creating social boundaries through rejection expression and value assertion.</p>
<p><strong>ANTICIPATION</strong> focuses on future-oriented preparation and expectation, creating forward momentum through planning and possibility exploration. Anticipation enables future navigation while building shared vision through expectation communication and preparation coordination.</p>
<p><strong>ACCEPTANCE</strong> expresses yielding, surrendering, and flow states that communicate flexibility and adaptation to circumstances. Acceptance enables conflict resolution while demonstrating wisdom through situation acknowledgment and resistance release.</p>
<p><strong>COMFORT</strong> provides soothing and safety to others through nurturing expression that creates emotional security and support. Comfort enables caregiving while building trust through safety provision and emotional support demonstration.</p>
<h2>Mixed Emotion Processing</h2>
<h3>Blending Mechanics</h3>
<p><strong>Primary-Secondary Blend Ratios</strong> combine dominant emotions at 70% strength with secondary emotions at 30% strength, creating realistic emotional complexity validated by research showing 77% effect size in meta-analysis. Blend ratios create nuanced expression while maintaining emotional clarity through weighted combination that reflects psychological reality.</p>
<p><strong>Processing Delay Integration</strong> introduces 200-500 millisecond delays for political ambivalence and complex emotion processing, creating realistic conversation rhythm through natural hesitation and consideration. Delay integration prevents instant responses while demonstrating cognitive processing through temporal variation and complexity acknowledgment.</p>
<p><strong>Ambivalence Expression</strong> enables simultaneous contradictory emotions through mixed state communication that reflects real emotional complexity during significant events with 93.43% frequency. Ambivalence creates authenticity while preventing oversimplification through complex emotional state acknowledgment.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Transition Smoothing</strong> interpolates between emotional states through gradual force weight adjustment that prevents jarring emotional switches while maintaining expression continuity. Transition smoothing creates natural flow while demonstrating emotional process rather than discrete state changes.</p>
<h3>Authenticity Strain System</h3>
<p><strong>Expressive Dissonance Measurement</strong> calculates strain between felt and expressed emotions, creating 18-32% cognitive performance reduction when maintaining emotional masks. Dissonance measurement creates consequences while encouraging authenticity through strain accumulation and performance impact.</p>
<p><strong>Micro-Expression Leakage</strong> reveals true emotions through involuntary expressions at high strain levels, creating tells that observant characters can detect and respond to. Leakage creates depth while rewarding observation through hidden emotion detection and authenticity assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Suppression Modifiers</strong> adjust strain costs based on cultural context including collectivist, individualist, and hierarchical social structures that affect expression appropriateness. Cultural modifiers create variety while reflecting real cultural differences in emotional expression and suppression expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Strain Recovery Mechanics</strong> enable authenticity restoration through genuine expression and emotional release that reduces accumulated strain and restores cognitive performance. Recovery mechanics prevent permanent damage while encouraging authentic expression through strain relief and performance restoration.</p>
<h2>Binary Choice Interface</h2>
<h3>LT/RT Selection System</h3>
<p><strong>Top Force Mapping</strong> assigns the two strongest emotional forces to left and right triggers, creating intuitive selection through dominant emotion presentation rather than menu navigation. Force mapping simplifies interface while maintaining complexity through emergent combination and contextual variation.</p>
<p><strong>Contextual Weight Calculation</strong> determines force strength through personality, energy level, cultural configuration, relationship context, and temporal bias that creates situation-appropriate options. Weight calculation creates variety while ensuring relevant choices through comprehensive context integration.</p>
<p><strong>Choice Difficulty Indication</strong> communicates decision complexity through visual feedback including selection time, option similarity, and emotional conflict that helps players understand choice significance. Difficulty indication supports decision-making while creating tension through complexity acknowledgment.</p>
<p><strong>Selection Confirmation Feedback</strong> provides immediate response through character expression, voice modulation, and body language that communicates chosen emotion before verbal response. Confirmation feedback creates responsiveness while demonstrating emotion through multiple channels.</p>
<h3>Emergent Complexity Design</h3>
<p><strong>Simple Rules Creating Complexity</strong> generates sophisticated emotional expression from basic force interactions, creating emergence rather than enumeration of all possible states. Emergent design enables variety while maintaining manageable complexity through rule-based generation.</p>
<p><strong>Process-Based Emotion Model</strong> treats emotions as continuous processes rather than discrete states, creating flow and evolution rather than state switching. Process models create naturalism while reflecting psychological reality through continuous emotional experience.</p>
<p><strong>Recursive Feedback Integration</strong> enables all systems to influence each other through feedback loops, creating complex dynamics from simple initial conditions. Recursive feedback creates depth while preventing predictability through system interdependence.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint-Based Authenticity</strong> creates realistic behavior through resource limits and system constraints rather than explicit programming of realistic responses. Constraint authenticity creates believability while reducing development complexity through natural limitation.</p>
<h2>Resource Exhaustion Framework</h2>
<h3>Conversation Depletion Mechanics</h3>
<p><strong>Emotional Range Reduction</strong> decreases available emotional forces as conversation continues, creating natural conversation conclusion through option limitation rather than arbitrary ending. Range reduction creates closure while reflecting real conversation fatigue through progressive constraint.</p>
<p><strong>Specificity Degradation</strong> shifts from specific to vague expression as resources deplete, creating realistic conversation decay through detail loss and generalization increase. Specificity degradation creates naturalism while preventing infinite conversation through quality reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Future Orientation Loss</strong> reduces anticipation and planning expression as exhaustion increases, creating present-focus through temporal range reduction. Orientation loss reflects fatigue while creating conversation conclusion through future discussion inability.</p>
<p><strong>Stress-Accelerated Consumption</strong> increases resource depletion rate during high-intensity emotional exchange, creating shorter conversations during conflict or crisis. Accelerated consumption creates variety while reflecting real emotional exhaustion through intensity impact.</p>
<h3>Recovery and Restoration</h3>
<p><strong>Time-Based Regeneration</strong> restores conversational resources through rest periods between interactions, creating natural conversation spacing through recovery requirements. Regeneration prevents spam while encouraging meaningful interaction through resource management.</p>
<p><strong>Activity-Based Recovery</strong> enables resource restoration through specific activities including solitude, creative expression, and physical activity that create gameplay integration. Activity recovery creates variety while supporting character routines through recovery behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship-Specific Pools</strong> maintains separate resource pools for different relationships, preventing single conversation from exhausting all social capacity. Specific pools create sustainability while enabling multiple relationships through resource separation.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Reserve Access</strong> provides limited additional resources during critical conversations through reserve activation that enables important discussions despite exhaustion. Reserve access creates drama while maintaining stakes through limited availability.</p>
