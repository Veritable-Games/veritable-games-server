# Level Environments

**Level Environments** in COSMIC KNIGHTS create tactical battlefields that
support Banner coordination while telling compelling stories through alien
architecture and environmental design.

## Design Philosophy

### Narrative Integration

Environmental design serves both **tactical gameplay needs** and **environmental
storytelling**, creating authentic alien battlefields that feel lived-in while
supporting strategic depth.

### Alien Architecture Principles

- **Non-Human Construction**: Organic curves and impossible geometries
  suggesting advanced alien engineering
- **Integrated Technology**: Technological systems seamlessly woven into
  structural elements
- **Cultural Indicators**: Environmental hints about alien civilization and
  mysterious purposes
- **Mysterious Features**: Architectural elements that spark curiosity and
  wonder

## Core Design Principles

### Illuminated Battlefields

**Visibility Philosophy**: Always well-lit environments ensuring clear tactical
awareness:

#### Natural Illumination

- **Bioluminescent Flora**: Alien plants providing organic, atmospheric lighting
- **Crystalline Formations**: Crystal structures glowing with inner energy
- **Environmental Effects**: Atmospheric lighting that enhances rather than
  obscures gameplay

#### Progressive Lighting

- **Corruption Effects**: Environmental corruption gradually affecting lighting
  conditions
- **Dynamic Systems**: Lighting that responds to
  [[cosmic-knights-fracture-warfare|Fracture]] presence and player actions
- **Tactical Clarity**: Maintaining clear sightlines despite atmospheric effects

### Tactical Awareness

- **Clear Sightlines**: No excessive darkness obscuring combat or movement
- **Strategic Positioning**: Lighting that reveals rather than conceals tactical
  opportunities
- **Atmospheric Enhancement**: Environmental lighting that adds immersion
  without hindering gameplay

## Tactical Integration

### [[cosmic-knights-banner-command|Banner Coordination]] Support

**Maps designed to support all Banner specializations:**

#### Guardian Banner Support

- **Defensive Positions**: Natural chokepoints and defensible locations
- **Cover Systems**: Environmental cover supporting defensive tactics
- **Fallback Routes**: Strategic withdrawal paths for defensive repositioning

#### Assault Banner Support

- **Breakthrough Routes**: Paths enabling aggressive advancement and flanking
- **Mobile Corridors**: Routes supporting rapid movement and position changes
- **Engagement Zones**: Areas optimized for close-quarters tactical combat

#### Siege Banner Support

- **Clear Fields**: Open areas enabling effective long-range weapon deployment
- **Strategic Overlooks**: Positions supporting battlefield observation and
  coordination

#### Recon Banner Support

- **Flexible Positioning**: Varied terrain supporting adaptive tactical
  approaches
- **Alternative Routes**: Multiple paths enabling creative tactical solutions
- **Information Gathering**: Positions providing battlefield intelligence
  advantages

### Environmental Interaction

#### [[cosmic-knights-corruption-pressure|Corruption]] Integration

- **Progressive Degradation**: Environmental conditions changing as corruption
  spreads
- **Interactive Systems**: Environmental elements requiring Banner coordination
  to operate
- **Restoration Rewards**: Environmental improvement when
  [[cosmic-knights-fracture-warfare|Fractures]] are sealed
- **Emergency Systems**: Crisis-activated environmental features providing
  tactical opportunities

#### [[cosmic-knights-crystal-economy|Crystal]] Distribution

- **Strategic Placement**: Crystal resources positioned to support tactical
  decision-making
- **Risk/Reward Balance**: Crystal locations requiring tactical risk for
  resource access
- **Team Coordination**: Crystal gathering requiring Banner cooperation and
  protection

## Map Categories

### Sealed Chambers

**Intimate environments emphasizing close Banner coordination:**

#### Design Features

- **Connected Rooms**: Multiple chambers supporting tactical variety and
  movement
- **Resource Distribution**: Crystal and equipment placement encouraging
  sustained operations
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Alien domestic architecture revealing cultural
  details
- **Close Coordination**: Spaces requiring tight Banner communication and
  synchronization

#### Tactical Applications

- **Close-Quarters Combat**: Environments optimized for Banner coordination in
  confined spaces
- **Resource Management**: Sustained operation requiring careful crystal and
  equipment usage
- **Stealth Elements**: Opportunities for careful movement and coordinated
  positioning

### Open Courtyards

**Large-scale battlefields supporting extended Banner operations:**

#### Design Features

- **Long-Range Engagement**: Open spaces enabling effective long-range weapon
  deployment
- **Multiple Objectives**: Several [[cosmic-knights-fracture-warfare|Fracture]]
  locations requiring strategic prioritization
- **Distributed Cover**: Defensive positions supporting all Banner
  specialization types
- **Extended Operations**: Crystal resources supporting longer tactical
  engagements

#### Tactical Applications

- **Strategic Coordination**: Large-scale Banner coordination and tactical
  planning
- **Specialization Integration**: Environments supporting all Banner types
  working together
- **Objective Control**: Managing multiple priorities requiring tactical
  decision-making

### Vertical Towers

**Multi-level complexes adding vertical tactical dimensions:**

#### Design Features

- **Elevation Advantages**: Height-based positioning providing strategic
  coordination benefits
- **Multi-Level Systems**: Environmental features spanning multiple floors and
  levels
- **Structural Dynamics**: Progressive corruption affecting building integrity
  and navigation
- **Vertical Movement**: Tactical opportunities requiring coordinated climbing
  and positioning

#### Tactical Applications

- **3D Coordination**: Banner tactical coordination across multiple elevation
  levels
- **Environmental Navigation**: Complex movement requiring team coordination and
  planning
- **Strategic Positioning**: Using elevation for tactical advantage and
  battlefield control

## Environmental Systems

### Interactive Elements

- **Alien Technology**: Environmental systems requiring Banner coordination to
  activate
- **Structural Features**: Architectural elements providing tactical
  opportunities
- **Emergency Systems**: Crisis-activated features providing tactical assistance
  or challenges

### Dynamic Responses

- **Corruption Adaptation**: Environmental changes responding to
  [[cosmic-knights-corruption-pressure|corruption pressure]]
- **Player Impact**: Environmental features responding to Banner actions and
  decisions
- **System Integration**: Environmental elements working with game mechanics
  rather than against them
