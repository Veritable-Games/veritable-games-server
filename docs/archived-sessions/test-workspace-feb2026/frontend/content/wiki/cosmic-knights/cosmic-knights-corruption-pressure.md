# Corruption Pressure

**Corruption Pressure** is the environmental degradation system in COSMIC
KNIGHTS that creates escalating challenges and dynamic battlefield conditions as
dimensional corruption spreads.

## System Overview

Corruption Pressure represents the **progressive environmental breakdown**
caused by dimensional fractures, creating time pressure and evolving tactical
challenges for Banner teams.

## Corruption Mechanics

### Progressive Degradation

**Environmental conditions that worsen over time:**

#### Environmental Effects

- **Atmospheric Contamination**: Air quality degradation affecting visibility
  and movement
- **Terrain Instability**: Ground and structural integrity declining as
  corruption spreads
- **Energy Disruption**: [[cosmic-knights-crystal-economy|Crystal]] systems
  becoming less effective in corrupted areas
- **Biological Contamination**: Flora and fauna transformation into hostile or
  dangerous forms

#### Temporal Pressure

- **Escalating Intensity**: Corruption effects increasing in severity over time
- **Threshold Events**: Significant corruption milestones triggering major
  environmental changes
- **Point of No Return**: Critical corruption levels beyond which areas become
  unrecoverable
- **Cascade Effects**: Corruption spreading to adjacent areas if not contained

### Dynamic Battlefield Changes

#### Tactical Adaptation Requirements

- **Changing Cover**: Environmental cover degrading or transforming as
  corruption spreads
- **Route Modification**: Paths becoming impassable, requiring tactical route
  adaptation
- **Resource Scarcity**: [[cosmic-knights-crystal-economy|Crystal]] and
  equipment effectiveness declining
- **Emergency Protocols**: Escalating corruption forcing rapid tactical
  decision-making

#### Strategic Implications

- **Time Management**: Corruption pressure creating urgency for
  [[cosmic-knights-fracture-warfare|Fracture]] sealing operations
- **Priority Assessment**: Teams must balance multiple objectives against
  corruption progression
- **Risk Evaluation**: Increasing environmental hazards affecting tactical risk
  calculations
- **Evacuation Planning**: Preparing for withdrawal if corruption becomes
  unmanageable

## Environmental Impact Categories

### [[cosmic-knights-level-environments|Atmospheric Effects]]

**Changes to air quality and atmospheric conditions:**

#### Visibility Degradation
