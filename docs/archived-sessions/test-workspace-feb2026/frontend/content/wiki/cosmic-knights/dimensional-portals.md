# Dimensional Portals

**Dimensional Portals** are gateways between dimensions in COSMIC KNIGHTS that
serve as both strategic objectives and sources of dimensional instability,
requiring Knight intervention to control or destroy.

## Portal Overview

Dimensional Portals represent **breach points in the fabric of reality** that
enable travel between dimensions while simultaneously threatening dimensional
stability and local environments.

## Portal Types

### Natural Portals

- **Dimensional Weak Points**: Areas where the barriers between dimensions are
  naturally thin
- **Cosmic Alignment**: Portals that open due to celestial or dimensional
  alignments
- **Ancient Artifacts**: Portals created by unknown civilizations or cosmic
  forces
- **Temporal Convergence**: Portals formed by temporal anomalies and time
  distortions

### Artificial Portals

- **Hostile Construction**: Portals deliberately created by antagonistic
  dimensional forces
- **Technology-Based**: Portals generated by advanced technology or dimensional
  science
- **Ritual Creation**: Portals opened through magical or spiritual practices
- **Accidental Formation**: Portals created unintentionally through
  experimentation or disaster

### Unstable Portals

- **Fluctuating Gateways**: Portals that open and close unpredictably
- **Size Variation**: Portals that change size and capacity over time
- **Dimensional Drift**: Portals that connect to different dimensions at
  different times
- **Decay States**: Portals gradually losing stability and threatening
  dimensional collapse

## Portal Mechanics

### Dimensional Access

- **Transit Capability**: Enabling travel between different dimensional realms
- **Selective Permeability**: Portals that allow some entities through while
  blocking others
- **Directional Control**: Portals with controllable entry and exit points
- **Capacity Limits**: Restrictions on the size and number of entities that can
  transit

### Environmental Effects

- **Dimensional Bleed**: Portal influence gradually affecting surrounding areas
- **Reality Distortion**: Portals causing changes in physical laws and natural
  processes
- **[[corrupted-territories|Corruption Spread]]**: Portals enabling corruption
  to spread into new areas
- **Energy Fluctuation**: Portals causing unpredictable energy surges and
  disruptions

### Stability Factors

- **Structural Integrity**: Portal stability and resistance to collapse or
  disruption
- **Maintenance Requirements**: Ongoing energy or intervention needed to
  maintain portal function
- **External Influence**: Portal stability affected by dimensional forces and
  Knight intervention
- **Closure Conditions**: Circumstances under which portals naturally close or
  can be forced closed

## Strategic Significance
