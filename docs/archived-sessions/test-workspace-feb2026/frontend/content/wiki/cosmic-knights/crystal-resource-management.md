# Crystal Resource Management

**Crystal Resource Management** forms the economic backbone of COSMIC KNIGHTS,
establishing a cooperative resource system where crystals collected by any team
member benefit the entire Banner rather than individual players. Unlike
traditional competitive resource systems that encourage hoarding and individual
optimization, crystal management requires democratic allocation through team
voting and consensus building that ensures resource distribution serves
collective success rather than personal advancement.

The crystal framework operates through **shared resource pools** where raw
crystals from environmental mining, refined crystals from conversion processes,
and specialized resources from combat performance flow into collective reserves
requiring team decisions for allocation. This system eliminates resource
competition between teammates while creating genuine cooperation requirements
through democratic investment planning and collective strategic development.

Crystal management emphasizes **democratic distribution** where team votes
determine resource allocation for Banner upgrades, equipment purchases, and
tactical deployments rather than individual spending decisions. The system
reinforces cooperative principles while providing strategic depth through
resource investment planning, conversion optimization, and long-term capability
development that rewards collective thinking over individual accumulation.

## Shared Resource Pool Framework

allocation for specific upgrades, equipment, or tactical deployments through
structured proposal systems. Proposal mechanisms create democratic participation
while preventing decision paralysis through time-limited voting windows and
clear proposal structures.

**Majority Threshold Requirements** establish voting standards for different
resource amounts where minor allocations require simple majority while major
investments demand super-majority approval. Threshold systems balance efficiency
with democracy through scaled approval requirements that prevent both autocracy
and gridlock.

**Emergency Allocation Protocols** provide rapid resource distribution during
combat crises through streamlined voting that maintains democratic principles
while enabling tactical responsiveness. Emergency protocols preserve cooperation
while supporting survival through accelerated decision processes that prioritize
immediate needs.

**Investment Planning Sessions** create dedicated strategic moments between
combat phases where teams evaluate long-term resource allocation through
comprehensive discussion and planning. Planning sessions encourage strategic
thinking while building team consensus through collaborative evaluation of
investment priorities and capability development paths.

### Distribution Priority Framework

**Tactical Necessity Allocation** prioritizes resource distribution for
immediate survival needs including health restoration, ammunition replenishment,
and critical equipment repair. Necessity allocation ensures team survival while
maintaining democratic oversight through rapid approval processes for essential
resource usage.

**Strategic Investment Planning** allocates resources toward long-term
capability development including Banner upgrades, weapon enhancements, and
defensive improvements that strengthen future performance. Investment planning
creates progression while requiring team agreement on development priorities
that shape tactical capabilities.

**Balanced Distribution Models** ensure equitable resource access across Banner
specializations through allocation formulas that consider role requirements and
contribution patterns. Distribution models prevent favoritism while maintaining
specialization support through fair resource access that enables all roles to
contribute effectively.

**Performance-Independent Access** guarantees resource availability regardless
of individual contribution metrics, ensuring that struggling players receive
support rather than punishment. Independent access maintains cooperation while
preventing toxic dynamics through resource democracy that values participation
over performance.

## Strategic Investment Planning

### Banner Upgrade Paths

**Collective Capability Development** invests crystals in Banner-wide
improvements including communication systems, tactical coordination, and
defensive matrices that benefit entire teams. Collective development reinforces
cooperation while creating shared progression through upgrades that enhance team
capability rather than individual power.

**Specialization Enhancement Tracks** develop specific Banner roles through
targeted investments in Guardian defenses, Assault weapons, Siege equipment, or
Recon systems. Enhancement tracks support role diversity while maintaining
balance through democratic approval that prevents single-specialization
dominance.

**Synergy Upgrade Systems** unlock combination abilities between Banner
specializations through coordinated investments that create tactical options
requiring multiple roles. Synergy systems reward cooperation while demonstrating
specialization interdependence through powerful combinations requiring team
