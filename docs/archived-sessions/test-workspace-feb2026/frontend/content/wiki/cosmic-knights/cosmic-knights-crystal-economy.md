# Crystal Resource Management

**Crystal Resource Management** is the core economic system in COSMIC KNIGHTS
that governs resource acquisition, distribution, and strategic allocation for
Banner tactical operations.

## System Overview

The Crystal Economy creates **strategic resource decisions** that integrate with
all Banner tactical operations, requiring coordination between individual
efficiency and team resource sharing.

## Core Economic Mechanics
