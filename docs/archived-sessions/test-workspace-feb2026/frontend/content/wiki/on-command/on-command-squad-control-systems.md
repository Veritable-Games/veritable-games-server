# ON COMMAND Squad Control Systems

## Strategic Points (SP) System

### Core Functionality

Strategic Points enable tactical positioning and battlefield control through
carefully placed cover locations. The SP system encourages interesting, fun
gameplay by providing structured defensive positions rather than relying on
conventional chest-high cover.

### SP Mechanics

- **Dynamic Cover Creation**: Squad members knock down, break, or move objects
  to create cover at SP locations
- **Automatic Fallback**: Squad members without assigned SP will automatically
  seek non-strategic cover positions
- **Tactical Highlighting**: Positions highlighted when crosshair aligns - white
  for unassigned, colored for occupied
- **Visual Feedback**: Squad member icons flash during communication, symbols
  show status (in cover, moving, etc.)

### SP Commands

**Assignment Commands:**

- **Assign SP**: Tap F/RB on desired position - abandons previous SP assignment
- **Unassign SP**: Tap F/RB on occupied position - recalls targeted squad member
- **Unassign All SP**: Hold F/RB without target - removes all squad members from
  active SPs
- **Fortify SP**: Hold F/RB on cover position to strengthen defensive
  capabilities

**Voice Examples:**

- Carden: "Set up there, Sentinel" / "Pack it up, Sentinel"
- Kalisa: "Taking cover!"
- Sorrel: "Ok!" / "I'll be there!"

## Emplacement Zones (EZ) System

### EZ Categories

#### Deployer Units

- **Function**: Elevator-like devices transporting units from factory below
- **Threat Level**: Gradual but persistent enemy reinforcement
- **Counter**: Disabled quickly with well-timed charge placement

#### Turret Systems

**ACP Turrets**: Autonomous operation, cannot be commandeered by enemies
**Stellan Turrets**: Require pilot operation - player can assign squad members
or operate directly

#### Distributor Stations

- **Primary Function**: Restore all health and nanites on first activation
- **Limitation**: Consecutive interactions provide no benefit
- **Restriction**: Only restores standard weapon nanites, not special ammunition

#### Friendly Deployer

- **Support**: Drone counterparts for human squads
- **Vulnerability**: Easily destroyed by M.A.G. rounds
- **Advantage**: Mass production provides early mission support edge

### EZ Commands

- **Setup EZ**: Tap F/RB on emplacement position
- **Destroy EZ**: Hold F/RB on emplacement position
- **Cycle EZ**: Hover reticle + scroll/LB to select equipment type
- **Fortify EZ**: Enhances emplacement defensive capabilities

## Actionable Objects (AO) System

### Terminal Operations

**Slicing Capabilities:**

- Breach fortified doors electronically
- Disable nearby turrets temporarily
- Disable droids linked to ACP power grid

**Destruction Option:**

- Permanent terminal destruction prevents enemy reversal of sliced systems
- **Slice Terminal**: Tap F/RB for access / **Wreck Terminal**: Hold F/RB for
  destruction

### Entrance Control

**Door Manipulation:**

- **Disable Entrance**: Hold F/RB to increase enemy breach time
- **Breach Entrance**: Tap F/RB to break through (often triggers alarms)
- Slicing process requires defending assigned squad member during operation

### Proximity Mine Systems

**Mine Types:**

- Floor-placed explosive devices requiring crouching approach for safety
- Potential trap locations that can be equipped with explosive devices
- **Disable Mine**: Tap F/RB to destroy / **Rewire Mine**: Hold F/RB for ally
  use

### Environmental Objects

- **Moveable Barriers**: Block entrances permanently
- **Scalable Platforms**: Secure vantage points in rooms
- **NPC Interactions**: Assist civilians (may cause squad members to stay
  behind)

## Time to Prepare (TTP) System

### Tactical Preparation Framework

- **Pre-encounter Setup**: Optimal time allocation before large waves/deadly
  encounters
- **Playtesting Determined**: Time constraints based on encounter difficulty
- **Progressive Challenge**: Time limits decrease as game difficulty increases
- **Preparation Advantage**: Unprepared players significantly less likely to
  survive

### Strategic Integration

TTP system works with SP/EZ/AO mechanics to create layered tactical preparation:

1. **Assign Strategic Points** for squad positioning
2. **Setup Emplacement Zones** for battlefield control
3. **Manipulate Actionable Objects** for environmental advantage
4. **Execute coordinated engagement** when preparation complete

## Communication & Feedback Systems

### Glottal Stops System

- **Command Acknowledgment**: Player character shouts squad member names
- **Response Confirmation**: Target character responds to confirm command
  received
- **Dialogue Interruption**: Natural conversation flow with tactical priority

### Visual Feedback Elements

- **Icon Communication**: Squad member icons flash during speech
- **Position Correlation**: Hovering over tactical position highlights
  corresponding squad icon
- **Status Symbols**: Overlay icons showing cover status, movement, object
  interaction

This sophisticated tactical framework enables deep squad-based combat while
maintaining accessibility through streamlined controls.
