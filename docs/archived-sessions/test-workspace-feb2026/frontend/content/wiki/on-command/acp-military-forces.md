# ACP Military Forces

## Overview

ACP (Allied Civil Preserve) Military Forces represent the human occupying forces
encountered during [[on-command-overview|ON COMMAND]] resistance operations.
These forces represent the primary human opposition, requiring specialized
non-lethal tactics due to their organic nature and the ethical complexity of
liberation warfare.

## Force Designation and Context

### Allied Civil Preserve Organization

**Military Structure**:

- **Designation**: ACP represents the formal military designation of occupying
  forces
- **Organizational Scale**: Large-scale military organization with established
  command structures
- **Equipment Standards**: Standardized armor, weapons, and tactical gear across
  force units
- **Training Level**: Professional military training with tactical awareness and
  combat capability

### Occupation Role

**Strategic Position**:

- **Territory Control**: Primary force responsible for maintaining control over
  occupied territories
- **Infrastructure Defense**: Protection of key installations and strategic
  locations
- **Population Management**: Control and oversight of civilian populations
- **Resource Extraction**: Military support for resource extraction and economic
  exploitation

## Combat Characteristics

### Standard ACP Soldier

**Equipment and Capabilities**:

- **Armor Systems**: Standard military-grade protective equipment and gear
- **Weapon Integration**: Equipped with
  [[mag-projectile-system|M.A.G. projectile systems]] and conventional military
  weapons
- **Tactical Training**: Professional tactical awareness including cover usage
  and equipment utilization
- **Environmental Adaptation**: Training for combat in varied environmental
  conditions

**Combat Profile**:

- **Tactical Awareness**: Demonstrated capability for cover usage and tactical
  positioning
- **Equipment Utilization**: Effective use of available military equipment and
  technology
- **Tactical Avoidance**: Strategic movement and positioning to avoid
  unnecessary exposure
- **Quick Elimination**: Despite tactical awareness, vulnerable to coordinated
  resistance attacks

**Combat Flow Pattern**:

1. **Positioning Phase**: Establish tactical positions using available cover and
   equipment
2. **Equipment Deployment**: Utilize standard military equipment for maximum
   tactical advantage
3. **Tactical Movement**: Execute strategic repositioning to maintain tactical
   advantage
4. **Defensive Response**: Respond to resistance attacks using conventional
   military tactics
5. **Withdrawal Protocol**: Execute tactical withdrawal when position becomes
   untenable

### Ethical Combat Requirements

**Non-Lethal Mandate**:

- **Organic Target Status**: ACP Soldiers must be neutralized using non-lethal
  tactics due to organic (human) nature
- **Elimination Speed**: Despite non-lethal requirement, neutralization can be
  accomplished quickly with proper tactics
- **Humanity Preservation**: "Faces not shown to maintain humanity" - design
  principle preserving human dignity
- **Moral Complexity**: Represents ethical challenges of liberation warfare
  against human forces

**Non-Lethal Systems**:

- **Equipment Targeting**: Focus on destroying equipment and armor rather than
  personnel
- **Incapacitation Methods**: Techniques for rendering soldiers non-combat
  effective without permanent harm
- **Exosuit Neutralization**: [[mag-projectile-system|Nanite projectiles]]
  designed to "neutralize enemy by destroying the exosuit they use during
  combat"
- **Immobilization Strategy**: "Destroying exosuit immobilizes target without
  lethal force"

## Strategic Integration

### Coordination with Mechanical Forces

**Combined Operations**:

- **[[enemy-units-mechanical|Mechanical Unit]] Support**: ACP forces coordinate
  with robotic units for enhanced tactical effectiveness
- **[[enemy-units-electronic|Electronic Warfare]] Integration**: Human forces
  coordinate electronic warfare operations
- **[[enemy-units-precision|Precision Support]]**: ACP forces provide support
  and coordination for precision operations
- **Technology Integration**: Human command coordinating with automated systems

### Command Structure

**Military Hierarchy**:

- **Officer Corps**: Professional military leadership coordinating resistance
  suppression
- **Communication Systems**: Advanced communication networks coordinating
  multi-unit operations
- **Strategic Planning**: Tactical and strategic planning capability for
  large-scale operations
- **Resource Management**: Military logistics and resource allocation for
  sustained operations

### Base Operations

**Infrastructure Control**:

- **Grand Voss Operations**: Primary base operations on
  [[planet-chione|Boreas moon]] during active conflict period
- **Facility Defense**: Protection of key military and industrial installations
- **Supply Lines**: Maintenance of supply lines for sustained military
  operations
- **Communication Networks**: Military communication and coordination
  infrastructure

## Technology Integration

### Equipment and Weapons

**Standard Military Technology**:

- **Protective Systems**: Military-grade armor and protective equipment
- **Weapon Systems**: [[mag-projectile-system|M.A.G. projectile weapons]] and
  conventional military armaments
- **Communication Equipment**: Advanced tactical communication systems
- **Transportation**: Military vehicles and transport systems for tactical
  mobility

### Tactical Technology

**Advanced Military Systems**:

- **Surveillance Equipment**: Advanced reconnaissance and surveillance
  capability
- **Coordination Systems**: Technology for coordinating with mechanical and
  electronic units
- **Defensive Systems**: Military installations and defensive fortifications
- **Logistics Technology**: Supply chain and resource management systems

## Resistance Encounter Dynamics

### Squad Engagement Requirements

**Tactical Challenges**:

- **Non-Lethal Constraint**: Resistance forces must use non-lethal methods
  despite ACP forces using lethal force
- **Professional Opposition**: ACP soldiers represent trained military
  opposition requiring tactical skill
- **Equipment Advantages**: ACP forces often have superior equipment and
  resources
- **Numerical Superiority**: ACP forces typically operate with numerical and
  resource advantages

### Liberation Ethics

**Moral Complexity**:

- **Human Opposition**: Resistance forces confronting human enemies rather than
  purely mechanical threats
- **Propaganda Warfare**: ACP soldiers may be victims of propaganda and
  misinformation
- **Civilian Status**: Some ACP soldiers may be conscripts or otherwise coerced
  into service
- **Post-Liberation Integration**: Consideration for post-conflict integration
  of neutralized ACP personnel

### Strategic Countermeasures

**Resistance Tactics**:

- **Equipment Targeting**: Focus on disabling equipment rather than personnel
- **[[on-command-nanite-military-systems|Nanite Weapons]]**: Use of nanite
  technology for non-lethal equipment neutralization
- **Tactical Coordination**:
  [[on-command-squad-control-systems|Squad Control Systems]] essential for
  coordinated non-lethal operations
- **Intelligence Gathering**: Information collection on ACP operations and
  personnel

## Cross-Timeline Context

### Historical Development

**Pre-Liberation Period**:

- **Occupation Establishment**: ACP forces established control following initial
  conquest
- **Resistance Emergence**: Growing resistance movement challenging ACP control
- **Escalation Period**: Increasing conflict between resistance and ACP forces
- **Liberation Campaign**: Full-scale resistance campaign for territorial
  liberation

### Post-War Integration

- **Personnel Processing**: Post-conflict processing of captured or surrendered
  ACP personnel
- **Reintegration Programs**: Programs for integrating former ACP personnel into
  post-liberation society
- **Technology Recovery**: Capture and repurposing of ACP military technology
  for peaceful applications
