# Dredge

_Weak Fast Melee Unit_

## Overview

Weak enemy that can only melee attack but moves very fast, designed to be easy
to eliminate but dangerous in swarms

**Unit Category**: [Mechanical Units](enemy-units-mechanical)

## Behavioral Profile

Fast-moving melee specialist that charges toward first enemy seen, then flails
around when damaged

## Technical Specifications

- **Form Factor**: Lightweight fast-moving chassis
- **Combat Capability**: Melee attacks only, no ranged weapons
- **Mobility**: Very fast movement but easy to eliminate
- **Health Pool**: Low health requiring minimal coordination to eliminate

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Target Acquisition**: Move towards the first enemy unit spotted
2. **Damage Response**: Flail around and lightly attempt to dodge attacks when
   damaged
3. **Death Protocol**: Withstand extra damage to die in an interesting way
4. **Swarm Tactics**: Dangerous in large numbers despite individual weakness

## Original Design Documentation

**Based on kick_ass_enemy_design.txt and On_Command_GDD.txt**

This unit documentation has been corrected to match the original design
specifications from the project development notes.

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate threat level relative to current battlefield
  conditions
- **Coordination Protocol**: Determine required squad coordination level for
  effective elimination
- **Equipment Selection**: Choose optimal weapons and equipment for engagement
- **Positioning Strategy**: Establish tactical positioning to maximize
  effectiveness while minimizing exposure

### Recommended Engagement

**Weapon Effectiveness**:

- **[M.A.G. Projectile System](mag-projectile-system)**: Standard effectiveness
  against mechanical units
- **[Nanite Military Systems](nanite-military-systems)**: Enhanced effectiveness
  due to specialized targeting capabilities
- **Squad Coordination**: Recommended for efficient elimination

**Communication Requirements**:

- **Unit Identification**: Clear communication of Dredge presence and position
- **Tactical Coordination**: Coordinate squad response based on unit
  capabilities
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate elimination priority relative to other
  battlefield threats

## Strategic Integration

### Battlefield Role

**Primary Function**: Direct assault and area control

**Force Multiplication**: Dredge units enhance effectiveness of other enemy
types through:

- **Tactical Synergy**: Capabilities complement other unit types
- **Resource Management**: Forces squad resource allocation decisions
- **Positioning Pressure**: Influences squad positioning and movement choices
- **Coordination Impact**: Indirectly affects coordination through tactical
  pressure

### Timeline Integration

**ON COMMAND Period Role**: Combat unit developed during resistance warfare
**Technology Evolution**: Mechanical systems adapted for post-war construction
**DODEC Era Legacy**: Technology principles incorporated into
[peaceful reconstruction](dodec-overview) systems
