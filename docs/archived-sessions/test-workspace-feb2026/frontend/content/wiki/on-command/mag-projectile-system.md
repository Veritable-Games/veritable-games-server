# M.A.G. Projectile System

## Overview

The M.A.G. (Malleable Acidic Gelatinous) Projectile System represents a
revolutionary weapons technology developed during the
[ON COMMAND](on-command-overview) resistance period. This innovative ammunition
system was specifically designed to counter the dense metal armor of enemy
forces when conventional ballistics proved ineffective.

## Technology Specifications

### Core Design Principles

**Chemical-Based Armor Penetration**:

- **Purpose**: Designed to slowly break down armor through chemical reaction
  rather than kinetic impact
- **Chemical Process**: Viscid substance begins chemical reaction that
  incinerates affected material
- **Fuel Limitation**: Only dissipating once projectile has expended its fuel
- **Material Targeting**: Specifically effective against dense metal armor and
  enemy exosuits

### Visual and Tactical Characteristics

**Projectile Diversity**:

- **Visual Design**: Visible projectiles varying in shape, color, speed, and
  damage by enemy type and weapon system
- **Tactical Identification**: Each enemy unit type uses distinct M.A.G.
  variants for battlefield identification
- **Cover Interaction**: Cannot destroy environmental cover, making positioning
  crucial for survival
- **Universal Deployment**: Used across multiple enemy unit types with varying
  effectiveness and characteristics

### Development Context

**Historical Innovation**:

- **Renlei Development**: Originally developed by Renlei soldiers when
  traditional ballistics proved ineffective against dense metal armor
