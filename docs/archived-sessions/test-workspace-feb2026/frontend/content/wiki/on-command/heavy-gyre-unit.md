# Heavy Gyre

_Large Bipedal Heavy Assault Unit_

## Overview

Large bipedal enemy with a huge health pool designed for direct frontal assault
without cover usage

**Unit Category**: [Mechanical Units](enemy-units-mechanical)

## Behavioral Profile

Aggressive direct assault unit that moves toward the furthest enemy, shoots
without using cover, and adapts to limb damage with melee or stationary fire

## Technical Specifications

- **Form Factor**: Large bipedal chassis with heavy armor
- **Health Pool**: Huge health pool requiring coordinated fire
- **Combat Style**: Direct assault without cover usage or flinching
- **Adaptability**: Combat adaptation based on limb damage

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Undamaged Phase**: Move towards furthest enemy and shoot without using
   cover or flinching
2. **Arm Damage Response**: If arms are lost, move towards nearest enemy for
   melee engagement
3. **Leg Damage Response**: If legs are lost, remain stationary and continue
   shooting
4. **Death Sequence**: Explode and trigger something interesting upon
   destruction

## Original Design Documentation

**Based on kick_ass_enemy_design.txt and On_Command_GDD.txt**

This unit documentation has been corrected to match the original design
specifications from the project development notes.

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate threat level relative to current battlefield
  conditions
- **Coordination Protocol**: Determine required squad coordination level for
  effective elimination
- **Equipment Selection**: Choose optimal weapons and equipment for engagement
- **Positioning Strategy**: Establish tactical positioning to maximize
  effectiveness while minimizing exposure

### Recommended Engagement

**Weapon Effectiveness**:

- **[M.A.G. Projectile System](mag-projectile-system)**: Standard effectiveness
  against mechanical units
- **[Nanite Military Systems](nanite-military-systems)**: Enhanced effectiveness
  due to specialized targeting capabilities
- **Squad Coordination**: Recommended for efficient elimination

**Communication Requirements**:

- **Unit Identification**: Clear communication of Heavy Gyre presence and
  position
- **Tactical Coordination**: Coordinate squad response based on unit
  capabilities
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate elimination priority relative to other
  battlefield threats

## Strategic Integration

### Battlefield Role

**Primary Function**: Direct assault and area control

**Force Multiplication**: Heavy Gyre units enhance effectiveness of other enemy
types through:

- **Tactical Synergy**: Capabilities complement other unit types
- **Resource Management**: Forces squad resource allocation decisions
- **Positioning Pressure**: Influences squad positioning and movement choices
- **Coordination Impact**: Indirectly affects coordination through tactical
  pressure

### Timeline Integration

**ON COMMAND Period Role**: Combat unit developed during resistance warfare
**Technology Evolution**: Mechanical systems adapted for post-war construction
**DODEC Era Legacy**: Technology principles incorporated into
[peaceful reconstruction](dodec-overview) systems
