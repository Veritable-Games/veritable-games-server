<h1>Squad Command System</h1>
<p>The <strong>Squad Command System</strong> in ON COMMAND establishes comprehensive tactical control over a six-person specialist team through sophisticated coordination mechanics that balance individual squad member autonomy with meaningful player command authority. Unlike traditional squad games where AI teammates serve as expendable resources, ON COMMAND creates genuine relationships between commander and squad through personality systems, skill specialization, and autonomous behavior that makes each squad member feel like a valued individual rather than tactical unit.</p>
<p>The squad framework operates through <strong>Strategic Points (SP) and Emplacement Zones (EZ)</strong> that provide tactical positioning and equipment deployment without requiring micromanagement, creating strategic depth through planning rather than reflexes. This system enables complex tactical operations while maintaining accessibility through intuitive command interfaces that scale from simple position orders to sophisticated multi-phase tactical coordination.</p>
<p>Squad command emphasizes <strong>character preservation</strong> where keeping squad members alive becomes both tactical necessity and emotional investment through developed relationships and irreplaceable expertise. The system creates genuine stakes through permanent character loss possibilities while providing tools for tactical success that reward careful planning over aggressive risk-taking or sacrificial strategies.</p>
