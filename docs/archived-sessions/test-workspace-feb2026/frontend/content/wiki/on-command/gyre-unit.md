# Gyre

_Basic Infantry Rolling Unit_

## Overview

Cylindrical robotic unit with high-speed rolling locomotion and infinite
deployment capability

**Unit Category**: [Mechanical Units](enemy-units-mechanical)

## Behavioral Profile

Fast-paced assault unit that rolls toward objectives, unrolls to return fire
when damaged, and operates emplacements when zones are unoccupied

## Technical Specifications

- **Form Factor**: Cylindrical robotic unit
- **Locomotion**: High-speed rolling configuration
- **Deployment**: Infinite spawning from strategic dispensers
- **Role**: Army backbone providing pressure and zone control

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Approach Phase**: Roll toward enemy or emplacement at maximum speed
2. **Damage Response**: Unroll and return fire when outer shell receives damage
3. **Objective Focus**: Attempt to set charges near priority emplacements
4. **Equipment Utilization**: Operate friendly emplacements when zones available
5. **Retreat Protocol**: Roll up and execute evasive maneuvers at low health
6. **Death Sequence**: Distinctive destruction animations for battlefield
   feedback

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate threat level relative to current battlefield
  conditions
- **Coordination Protocol**: Determine required squad coordination level for
  effective elimination
- **Equipment Selection**: Choose optimal weapons and equipment for engagement
- **Positioning Strategy**: Establish tactical positioning to maximize
  effectiveness while minimizing exposure

### Recommended Engagement

**Weapon Effectiveness**:

- **[M.A.G. Projectile System](mag-projectile-system)**: Standard effectiveness
  against mechanical units
- **[Nanite Military Systems](nanite-military-systems)**: Enhanced effectiveness
  due to specialized targeting capabilities
- **Squad Coordination**: Recommended for efficient elimination

**Communication Requirements**:

- **Unit Identification**: Clear communication of Gyre presence and position
- **Tactical Coordination**: Coordinate squad response based on unit
  capabilities
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate elimination priority relative to other
  battlefield threats

## Strategic Integration

### Battlefield Role

**Primary Function**: Direct assault and area control

**Force Multiplication**: Gyre units enhance effectiveness of other enemy types
through:

- **Tactical Synergy**: Capabilities complement other unit types
- **Resource Management**: Forces squad resource allocation decisions
- **Positioning Pressure**: Influences squad positioning and movement choices
- **Coordination Disruption**: Indirectly affects coordination through tactical
  pressure

### Timeline Integration

**ON COMMAND Period Role**: Combat unit developed during resistance warfare
**Technology Evolution**: Mechanical systems adapted for post-war construction
**DODEC Era Legacy**: Technology principles incorporated into
[peaceful reconstruction](dodec-overview) systems
