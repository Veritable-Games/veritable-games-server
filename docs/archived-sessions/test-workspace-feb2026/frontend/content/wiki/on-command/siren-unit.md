# Siren

_Communication Disruptor_

## Overview

Highly mobile biped unit using deafening sound projection to disable squad
communication and coordination

**Unit Category**: [Electronic Units](enemy-units-electronic)

## Behavioral Profile

Rapidly repositions to optimal locations before executing
communication-disrupting attacks that prevent tactical coordination

## Technical Specifications

- **Body Configuration**: Lanky biped design optimized for environmental
  navigation
- **Movement Capability**: Superior traversal allowing rapid position changes
- **Weapon System**: Deafening sound projection for stunning and disorientation
- **Effect Duration**: Communication prevention for tactically significant
  periods

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Approach Phase**: Rapid movement toward nearest enemy position
2. **Setup Period**: Several seconds preparation before disruptive attack
3. **Stun Attack**: Emerge from cover to disable communications
4. **Aggressive Variant**: Immediate attack with self-destruction explosion
   option
5. **Death Sequence**: Distinctive destruction animation with high mobility

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate threat level relative to current battlefield
  conditions
- **Coordination Protocol**: Determine required squad coordination level for
  effective elimination
- **Equipment Selection**: Choose optimal weapons and equipment for engagement
- **Positioning Strategy**: Establish tactical positioning to maximize
  effectiveness while minimizing exposure

### Recommended Engagement

**Weapon Effectiveness**:

- **[M.A.G. Projectile System](mag-projectile-system)**: Standard effectiveness
  against electronic units
- **[Nanite Military Systems](nanite-military-systems)**: Enhanced effectiveness
  due to specialized targeting capabilities
- **Squad Coordination**: Critical for disruption removal

**Communication Requirements**:

- **Unit Identification**: Clear communication of Siren presence and position
- **Tactical Coordination**: Coordinate squad response based on unit
  capabilities
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate elimination priority relative to other
  battlefield threats

## Strategic Integration

### Battlefield Role

**Primary Function**: Communication disruption and equipment interference

**Force Multiplication**: Siren units enhance effectiveness of other enemy types
through:

- **Tactical Synergy**: Capabilities complement other unit types
- **Resource Management**: Forces squad resource allocation decisions
- **Positioning Pressure**: Influences squad positioning and movement choices
- **Coordination Disruption**: Directly disrupts squad coordination capabilities

### Timeline Integration

**ON COMMAND Period Role**: Combat unit developed during resistance warfare
**Technology Evolution**: Electronic warfare technology repurposed for community
communication **DODEC Era Legacy**: Technology principles incorporated into
[peaceful reconstruction](dodec-overview) systems
