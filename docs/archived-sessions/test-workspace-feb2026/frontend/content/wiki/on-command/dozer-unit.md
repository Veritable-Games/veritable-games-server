# Dozer

_Heavy Support Deployment Unit_

## Overview

Enemy with large health pool that slowly moves towards enemy cover and deploys
squad of Gyres upon entering battlefield

**Unit Category**: [Mechanical Units](enemy-units-mechanical)

## Behavioral Profile

Heavy support unit focused on cover destruction and Gyre deployment, with
adaptive movement when damaged

## Technical Specifications

- **Form Factor**: Heavy chassis with large health pool and slow movement
- **Primary Function**: Cover destruction and Gyre squad deployment
- **Deployment Capability**: Deploys squad of Gyres upon battlefield entry
- **Durability**: Large health pool with damage adaptation systems

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Deployment Phase**: Deploy squad of Gyres upon entering battlefield
2. **Assault Objective**: Move towards nearest enemy cover position and destroy
   it
3. **Damage Adaptation**: If one tread lost, continue moving toward objective
   with backup attempts
4. **Desperation Protocol**: Veer into nearest non-cover obstacle if destroyed
5. **Suicide Protocol**: Execute suicide attack if no enemy cover present after
   X damage

## Original Design Documentation

**Based on kick_ass_enemy_design.txt and On_Command_GDD.txt**

This unit documentation has been corrected to match the original design
specifications from the project development notes.

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate threat level relative to current battlefield
  conditions
- **Coordination Protocol**: Determine required squad coordination level for
  effective elimination
- **Equipment Selection**: Choose optimal weapons and equipment for engagement
- **Positioning Strategy**: Establish tactical positioning to maximize
  effectiveness while minimizing exposure

### Recommended Engagement

**Weapon Effectiveness**:

- **[M.A.G. Projectile System](mag-projectile-system)**: Standard effectiveness
  against mechanical units
- **[Nanite Military Systems](nanite-military-systems)**: Enhanced effectiveness
  due to specialized targeting capabilities
- **Squad Coordination**: Recommended for efficient elimination

**Communication Requirements**:

- **Unit Identification**: Clear communication of Dozer presence and position
- **Tactical Coordination**: Coordinate squad response based on unit
  capabilities
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate elimination priority relative to other
  battlefield threats

## Strategic Integration

### Battlefield Role

**Primary Function**: Direct assault and area control

**Force Multiplication**: Dozer units enhance effectiveness of other enemy types
through:

- **Tactical Synergy**: Capabilities complement other unit types
- **Resource Management**: Forces squad resource allocation decisions
- **Positioning Pressure**: Influences squad positioning and movement choices
- **Coordination Impact**: Indirectly affects coordination through tactical
  pressure

### Timeline Integration

**ON COMMAND Period Role**: Combat unit developed during resistance warfare
**Technology Evolution**: Mechanical systems adapted for post-war construction
**DODEC Era Legacy**: Technology principles incorporated into
[peaceful reconstruction](dodec-overview) systems
