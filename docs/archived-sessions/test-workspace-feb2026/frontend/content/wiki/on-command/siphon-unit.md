# Siphon

_Energy Drain Attachment Unit_

## Overview

Flying unit that latches onto first enemy target to drain energy through direct
power supply connection

**Unit Category**: [Electronic Units](enemy-units-electronic)

## Behavioral Profile

Aerial attachment specialist that connects to enemy power systems and drains
energy until manually removed

## Technical Specifications

- **Mobility System**: Flying unit with aerial battlefield maneuverability
- **Attachment Method**: Latches onto first enemy target within operational
  range
- **Energy Drain**: Direct power supply connection through armor slashing
- **Removal Requirement**: Self-removal possible but ally assistance
  significantly faster

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Target Selection**: Fly into battlefield and latch onto first enemy target
   in range
2. **Energy Drain**: Slash into armor and connect directly to power supply
3. **Sustained Drain**: Continue draining energy for as long as attachment
   maintained
4. **Removal Resistance**: Resist removal attempts while maintaining power
   connection

## Original Design Documentation

**Based on kick_ass_enemy_design.txt and On_Command_GDD.txt**

This unit documentation has been corrected to match the original design
specifications from the project development notes.

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate threat level relative to current battlefield
  conditions
- **Coordination Protocol**: Determine required squad coordination level for
  effective elimination
- **Equipment Selection**: Choose optimal weapons and equipment for engagement
- **Positioning Strategy**: Establish tactical positioning to maximize
  effectiveness while minimizing exposure

### Recommended Engagement

**Weapon Effectiveness**:

- **[M.A.G. Projectile System](mag-projectile-system)**: Standard effectiveness
  against electronic units
- **[Nanite Military Systems](nanite-military-systems)**: Enhanced effectiveness
  due to specialized targeting capabilities
- **Squad Coordination**: Critical for disruption removal

**Communication Requirements**:

- **Unit Identification**: Clear communication of Siphon presence and position
- **Tactical Coordination**: Coordinate squad response based on unit
  capabilities
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate elimination priority relative to other
  battlefield threats

## Strategic Integration

### Battlefield Role

**Primary Function**: Electronic warfare and equipment interference

**Force Multiplication**: Siphon units enhance effectiveness of other enemy
types through:

- **Tactical Synergy**: Capabilities complement other unit types
- **Resource Management**: Forces squad resource allocation decisions
- **Positioning Pressure**: Influences squad positioning and movement choices
- **Coordination Impact**: Directly disrupts squad coordination capabilities

### Timeline Integration

**ON COMMAND Period Role**: Combat unit developed during resistance warfare
**Technology Evolution**: Electronic warfare technology repurposed for community
communication **DODEC Era Legacy**: Technology principles incorporated into
[peaceful reconstruction](dodec-overview) systems
