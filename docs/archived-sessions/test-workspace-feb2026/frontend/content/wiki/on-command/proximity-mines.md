# Proximity Mines

**Proximity Mines** are deployable explosive devices used in ON COMMAND
operations, designed for area denial and tactical control consistent with the
project's non-lethal approach to human opponents.

## Technology Overview

Proximity mines represent advanced battlefield control technology that
prioritizes **incapacitation over elimination**, reflecting ON COMMAND's
commitment to minimizing casualties while maintaining tactical effectiveness.

## Mine Types and Functions

### Non-Lethal Variants

**Primary mine types designed for human opponents:**

#### Stun Mines

- **Electrical Discharge**: High-voltage, low-amperage electrical shock designed
  to incapacitate without permanent injury
- **Neural Disruption**: Temporary nervous system interference causing
  disorientation and motor function loss
- **Recovery Time**: Effects lasting 15-30 minutes, allowing for prisoner
  processing or tactical repositioning
- **Safety Protocols**: Automatic shutdown systems preventing accidental
  fatalities

#### Sonic Mines

- **Auditory Incapacitation**: High-intensity sound waves causing temporary
  hearing loss and disorientation
- **Crowd Control**: Effective against multiple opponents in confined spaces
- **Non-Permanent Effects**: Hearing recovery within hours to days depending on
  exposure
- **Directional Targeting**: Focused sound cones minimizing collateral impact

#### Restraint Mines

- **Entanglement Systems**: Deploying nets, cables, or adhesive materials to
  physically restrain opponents
- **Mobility Denial**: Preventing movement without causing physical harm
- **Time Delay Release**: Automatic release mechanisms preventing indefinite
  restraint
- **Emergency Override**: Manual release capabilities for humanitarian
  situations

### Anti-Droid Variants

**Specialized mines for mechanical opponents where lethal force is acceptable:**

#### EMP Mines

- **Electromagnetic Pulse**: Disabling electronic systems in droid opponents
- **Circuit Disruption**: Overloading mechanical control systems
- **Temporary vs. Permanent**: Variable intensity settings for mission
  requirements
- **Shielding Considerations**: Effectiveness varies based on droid
  electromagnetic protection

#### Fragmentation Mines

- **Mechanical Destruction**: High-explosive devices designed to destroy droid
  opponents
- **Targeted Deployment**: Used specifically in areas where only mechanical
  opponents are expected
- **Collateral Protection**: Designed to minimize risk to human personnel in the
  area
- **Environmental Considerations**: Fragmentation patterns designed to limit
  structural damage

### Psychological Warfare

- **Deterrent Effect**: Known mine presence affecting opponent decision-making
- **Stress Induction**: Uncertainty about mine locations creating psychological
  pressure
- **Route Modification**: Forcing opponents to take longer or more dangerous
  paths
- **Confidence Reduction**: Mine encounters reducing opponent willingness to
  advance
