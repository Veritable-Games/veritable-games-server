# Scope

_Precision Sniper Unit_

## Overview

Long-range precision unit with massive damage potential, mobile cover system,
and periscope-based targeting

**Unit Category**: [Precision Units](enemy-units-precision)

## Behavioral Profile

Utilizes superior positioning and patience to eliminate targets during movement,
requiring charge-up for maximum effectiveness

## Technical Specifications

- **Damage System**: Massive damage potential with charge-up mechanism
- **Health Configuration**: Very low durability requiring defensive positioning
- **Defensive Equipment**: Mobile cover system deployable within seconds
- **Targeting System**: Periscope-based observation for hidden positioning

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Positioning Phase**: Locate optimal cover and establish periscope
   observation
2. **Target Elimination**: High-damage strikes during enemy movement
3. **Damage Response**: Suppressive fire if periscope destroyed
4. **Retreat Pattern**: Mobile cover utilization during tactical withdrawal
5. **Death Protocol**: Continue retreat while dying, serving as bullet magnet

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate threat level relative to current battlefield
  conditions
- **Coordination Protocol**: Determine required squad coordination level for
  effective elimination
- **Equipment Selection**: Choose optimal weapons and equipment for engagement
- **Positioning Strategy**: Establish tactical positioning to maximize
  effectiveness while minimizing exposure

### Recommended Engagement

**Weapon Effectiveness**:

- **[M.A.G. Projectile System](mag-projectile-system)**: Standard effectiveness
  against precision units
- **[Nanite Military Systems](nanite-military-systems)**: Enhanced effectiveness
  due to specialized targeting capabilities
- **Squad Coordination**: Essential for high-priority elimination

**Communication Requirements**:

- **Unit Identification**: Clear communication of Scope presence and position
- **Tactical Coordination**: Coordinate squad response based on unit
  capabilities
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate elimination priority relative to other
  battlefield threats

## Strategic Integration

### Battlefield Role

**Primary Function**: Long-range elimination and area denial

**Force Multiplication**: Scope units enhance effectiveness of other enemy types
through:

- **Tactical Synergy**: Capabilities complement other unit types
- **Resource Management**: Forces squad resource allocation decisions
- **Positioning Pressure**: Influences squad positioning and movement choices
- **Coordination Disruption**: Indirectly affects coordination through tactical
  pressure

### Timeline Integration

**ON COMMAND Period Role**: Combat unit developed during resistance warfare
**Technology Evolution**: Specialized systems integrated into peaceful
applications **DODEC Era Legacy**: Technology principles incorporated into
[peaceful reconstruction](dodec-overview) systems
