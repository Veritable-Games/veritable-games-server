# Emplacement Zones (EZ) System

**Emplacement Zones (EZ)** are buildable defensive positions in ON COMMAND that
allow squads to construct temporary fortifications and tactical advantages
during combat operations.

## System Overview

The EZ system transforms static battlefield control into dynamic construction
gameplay, where teams can create, modify, and destroy defensive positions as
tactical situations evolve.

## Core Mechanics

### Construction Requirements

- **Setup Time**: EZ construction requires
  [[time-to-prepare-system|Time to Prepare (TTP)]] allocation
- **Resource Investment**: Equipment and personnel commitment needed for
  establishment
- **Location Restrictions**: EZ placement limited to tactically appropriate
  positions
- **Team Coordination**: Multi-person construction for larger or more complex
  emplacements

### Fortification Types

- **Cover Positions**: Basic defensive structures providing protection from
  enemy fire
- **Weapon Emplacements**: Mounted positions for heavy weapons or specialized
  equipment
- **Communication Centers**: Enhanced coordination and intelligence gathering
  positions
- **Supply Caches**: Secure storage and distribution points for ammunition and
  equipment

## Integration with Strategic Points

### Enhanced Control

EZ systems work in conjunction with
[[strategic-points-system|Strategic Points (SP)]]:

- **Point Reinforcement**: EZ construction strengthens control of valuable
  strategic positions
- **Defensive Multiplication**: Converting temporary point control into lasting
  advantage
- **Area Denial**: Creating zones that restrict enemy movement and positioning
  options
- **Fallback Positions**: Prepared defensive lines for tactical withdrawals

### Resource Coordination

- **[[nanite-technology|Nanite Integration]]**: Using nanite construction
  capabilities for rapid EZ deployment
- **Equipment Distribution**: EZ systems facilitate equipment access and
  resupply
- **Communication Enhancement**: Emplacements improve squad coordination and
  battlefield awareness
- **Tactical Networking**: Connected EZ positions create defensive networks

## Squad Specialization Integration

### Character-Specific Advantages

Different [[on-command-character-classes|squad members]] excel at various EZ
functions:

- **Engineering Specialists**: Faster construction and more durable emplacements
- **Combat Veterans**: Optimized weapon emplacement positioning and
  effectiveness
- **Communication Experts**: Enhanced intelligence and coordination emplacements
- **Medical Personnel**: Casualty treatment and evacuation emplacement
  configurations

### Team Coordination

- **Synchronized Construction**: Multiple squad members working together on
  large emplacements
- **Specialized Assignments**: Different team members handling specific
  emplacement functions
- **Adaptive Roles**: Team members shifting between construction and security
  roles
- **Cross-Training**: All squad members capable of basic EZ operations

## Tactical Applications

### Defensive Operations

- **Chokepoint Control**: EZ construction to funnel and control enemy movement
- **Overlapping Fields**: Multiple emplacements creating interlocking defensive
  zones
- **Layered Defense**: Progressive fallback positions prepared through EZ
  construction
- **Civilian Protection**: Emplacements designed to shield non-combatants from
  conflict

### Offensive Support

- **Forward Positions**: EZ construction to support advancing operations
- **Staging Areas**: Temporary positions for regrouping and resupply during
  advances
- **Breach Support**: Specialized emplacements for breaking enemy defensive
  positions
- **Communication Relay**: Forward EZ positions extending command and control
  range

## Non-Lethal Integration

### Humanitarian Applications

Consistent with ON COMMAND's non-lethal approach:

- **Crowd Control**: EZ designs focused on controlling rather than eliminating
  opponents
- **Civilian Safety**: Emplacement configurations that protect non-combatants
- **Intimidation Tactics**: Psychological impact of well-prepared positions
- **De-escalation Support**: Defensive positions that enable negotiation rather
  than fighting

### Neutralization Focus

- **Containment Systems**: EZ configurations for trapping rather than destroying
  enemies
- **Non-Lethal Weapons**: Emplacement integration with stun and disabling
  systems
- **Evacuation Routes**: EZ designs that provide enemy escape options
- **Medical Support**: Emplacements configured for treating injured opponents

## Environmental Integration

### Atlas Tether Warfare

Within [[atlas-tether|Atlas Tether]] urban environments:

- **Vertical Positions**: EZ construction utilizing multi-level architecture
- **Civilian Integration**: Emplacements that work around populated areas
- **Infrastructure Preservation**: Construction that maintains essential city
  systems
- **Rapid Deployment**: EZ systems adapted to complex urban terrain

### Terrain Adaptation

- **Environmental Materials**: Using local resources for emplacement
  construction
- **Weather Resistance**: EZ designs adapted to local climate conditions
- **Camouflage Integration**: Emplacements that blend with natural terrain
- **Mobility Options**: EZ systems that can be relocated as tactical needs
  change

## Faction Dynamics

### Allied Civil Preserve (ACP)

- **Resource Advantage**: Better access to construction materials and equipment
- **Standardized Systems**: Consistent EZ designs across ACP operations
- **Logistical Support**: Established supply chains for emplacement construction
- **Training Integration**: EZ construction part of standard ACP tactical
  doctrine

### Stellan Liberation Forces

- **Improvised Solutions**: Creative EZ construction using available materials
- **Local Knowledge**: Understanding of terrain advantages for optimal EZ
  placement
- **Guerrilla Applications**: EZ systems adapted for irregular warfare tactics
- **Community Support**: Local population assistance with emplacement
  construction
