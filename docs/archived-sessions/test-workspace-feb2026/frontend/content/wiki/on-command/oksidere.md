# Oksidere (Oksi)

## Overview

**Oksidere** (Norwegian: "to rust/oxidize", nicknamed **Oksi**) is a central NPC
character in ON COMMAND - a reprogrammed ACP Gyre droid converted to an AEI
(Artificial Entity Intelligence) who serves as a critical squad member and
technical specialist for the resistance liberation force.

As an NPC companion, Oksidere provides unique capabilities through his
artificial intelligence and technical expertise, while developing complex
relationships with human squad members throughout the campaign.

## Background

Originally part of the Renlei military forces, Oksidere was salvaged after a
battle by Gregers Ovesen, who sarcastically named the droid "Oksidere"
(Norwegian for "to rust/oxidize") - later affectionately shortened to "Oksi".
During the reprogramming process, Gregers unknowingly granted the droid
autonomous thought capabilities, transforming it from a simple military unit
into a self-aware artificial intelligence.
