# Ultra Gyre

_Armored Heavy Gyre with Dual Targeting_

## Overview

An armored version of the Heavy Gyre with a gigantic health pool requiring full
squad teamwork to eliminate

**Unit Category**: [Mechanical Units](enemy-units-mechanical)

## Behavioral Profile

Dual-targeting heavy assault unit that can engage two enemies simultaneously and
execute crushing attacks when exposed

## Technical Specifications

- **Form Factor**: Armored Heavy Gyre variant with dual targeting systems
- **Health Pool**: Gigantic health pool requiring full squad coordination
- **Weapon Systems**: Dual targeting capability for simultaneous enemy
  engagement
- **Armor Configuration**: Two adjacent outer shells creating X-shaped
  silhouette

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Targeting Phase**: Move towards furthest two enemies and shoot both targets
   simultaneously
2. **Exposure Response**: If limbs are exposed, move to targets at 2x speed for
   crushing attacks
3. **Crush Attack**: Pick up and crush single target when at close range
4. **Death Explosion**: Explode and destroy cover or severely damage nearby
   enemy units

## Original Design Documentation

**Based on kick_ass_enemy_design.txt and On_Command_GDD.txt**

This unit documentation has been corrected to match the original design
specifications from the project development notes.

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate threat level relative to current battlefield
  conditions
- **Coordination Protocol**: Determine required squad coordination level for
  effective elimination
- **Equipment Selection**: Choose optimal weapons and equipment for engagement
- **Positioning Strategy**: Establish tactical positioning to maximize
  effectiveness while minimizing exposure

### Recommended Engagement

**Weapon Effectiveness**:

- **[M.A.G. Projectile System](mag-projectile-system)**: Standard effectiveness
  against mechanical units
- **[Nanite Military Systems](nanite-military-systems)**: Enhanced effectiveness
  due to specialized targeting capabilities
- **Squad Coordination**: Recommended for efficient elimination

**Communication Requirements**:

- **Unit Identification**: Clear communication of Ultra Gyre presence and
  position
- **Tactical Coordination**: Coordinate squad response based on unit
  capabilities
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate elimination priority relative to other
  battlefield threats

## Strategic Integration

### Battlefield Role

**Primary Function**: Direct assault and area control

**Force Multiplication**: Ultra Gyre units enhance effectiveness of other enemy
types through:

- **Tactical Synergy**: Capabilities complement other unit types
- **Resource Management**: Forces squad resource allocation decisions
- **Positioning Pressure**: Influences squad positioning and movement choices
- **Coordination Impact**: Indirectly affects coordination through tactical
  pressure

### Timeline Integration

**ON COMMAND Period Role**: Combat unit developed during resistance warfare
**Technology Evolution**: Mechanical systems adapted for post-war construction
**DODEC Era Legacy**: Technology principles incorporated into
[peaceful reconstruction](dodec-overview) systems
