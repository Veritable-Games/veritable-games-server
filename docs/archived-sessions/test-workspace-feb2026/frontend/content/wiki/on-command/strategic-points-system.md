# Strategic Points (SP) System

The **Strategic Points (SP) System** is a core tactical positioning mechanic in
ON COMMAND that governs squad placement, area control, and strategic advantage
during combat operations.

## System Overview

Strategic Points represent tactically significant positions within the
battlefield that provide operational advantages to the squad that controls them.
The SP system transforms combat from simple shooting into strategic territorial
control.

## Core Mechanics

### Point Acquisition

- **Contested Control**: Multiple squads can compete for the same strategic
  position
- **Capture Requirements**: Specific actions or presence duration needed to
  secure points
- **Resource Investment**: Some points require equipment or personnel commitment
  to maintain
- **Risk Assessment**: Higher value points typically involve greater exposure to
  enemy fire

### Tactical Advantages

- **Line of Sight**: Strategic points provide superior observation and firing
  positions
- **Cover Enhancement**: Natural or constructed protection from enemy attacks
- **Mobility Corridors**: Control key pathways for squad movement and flanking
  maneuvers
- **Resource Access**: Some points provide equipment, ammunition, or other
  tactical resources

## Integration with Squad Command

### 6-Person Team Coordination

The SP system works with ON COMMAND's
[[on-command-character-classes|6-person squad structure]]:

- **Role Specialization**: Different squad members excel at controlling
  different point types
- **Coordinated Advances**: Multi-point captures require synchronized team
  movement
- **Defensive Assignments**: Squad members assigned to specific point defense
  roles

### Mission Selection Impact

- **Squad Subset Strategy**: Choosing which squad members to deploy affects
  point control capacity
- **Specialist Advantages**: Certain characters excel at specific strategic
  point types
- **Resource Allocation**: Balancing personnel between offensive and defensive
  point control

## Types of Strategic Points

### Observation Posts

- **Intelligence Gathering**: Provide enhanced awareness of enemy positions and
  movement
- **Communication Advantage**: Enable better coordination with other friendly
  forces
- **Sniper Positions**: Optimal locations for long-range engagement specialists

### Defensive Positions

- **Chokepoint Control**: Command narrow passages and funnel enemy movement
- **Fortification Potential**: Can be enhanced with
  [[emplacement-zones-system|Emplacement Zones]]
- **Fallback Positions**: Prepared defensive locations for tactical withdrawals

### Resource Nodes

- **Supply Access**: Control ammunition, medical supplies, and equipment caches
- **Nanite Distribution**: Access to [[nanite-technology|Nanite Technology]]
  resources
- **Terminal Control**: Hackable systems that provide tactical information or
  advantages

## Time to Prepare (TTP) Integration

The SP system works closely with
[[time-to-prepare-system|Time to Prepare (TTP)]] mechanics:

- **Pre-Planning**: TTP phases allow squads to identify and prioritize strategic
  points
- **Route Planning**: Teams can coordinate approaches to multiple points during
  preparation
- **Contingency Development**: Backup plans for point control if primary
  strategies fail

## Non-Lethal Focus Alignment

Consistent with ON COMMAND's non-lethal approach to human opponents:

- **Area Denial**: Strategic points focus on controlling space rather than
  eliminating enemies
- **Neutralization Tactics**: Disabling enemy access to points without causing
  casualties
- **Humanitarian Considerations**: Point control strategies that minimize
  civilian impact

## Faction Dynamics

### Allied Civil Preserve (ACP)

- **Occupation Advantage**: ACP forces often start with control of established
  strategic points
- **Infrastructure Access**: Better equipped positions with advanced technology
- **Defensive Posture**: Focus on maintaining control of existing advantageous
  positions

### Stellan Liberation Forces

- **Guerrilla Tactics**: Excel at capturing points through unconventional
  approaches
- **Local Knowledge**: Understand terrain advantages invisible to occupying
  forces
- **Rapid Mobility**: Specialize in quick point captures and tactical
  withdrawals

## Environmental Integration

### Atlas Tether Architecture

Within [[atlas-tether|Atlas Tethers]], strategic points take advantage of:

- **Vertical Advantages**: Multi-level positioning in scaffolded cities
- **Infrastructure Control**: Key systems that affect entire tether sections
- **Civilian Considerations**: Points near populated areas require careful
  approach

### Svalbard Terrain

The [[svalbard-setting|Svalbard archipelago setting]] provides unique strategic
point types:

- **Weather Advantages**: Positions that provide protection from harsh
  conditions
- **Resource Scarcity**: Points that control access to limited supplies
- **Communication Lines**: Positions that enable or disrupt long-range
  communication
