# Anchor

_Heavy Artillery Support Unit_

## Overview

Heavily armored cannon that crawls slowly and can only shoot while stationary,
focusing on long-range support

**Unit Category**: [Support Units](enemy-units-support)

## Behavioral Profile

Stationary artillery unit that maintains distance from targets and alternates
between ranged fire and close-quarters defense

## Technical Specifications

- **Form Factor**: Heavily armored cannon with crawling mobility
- **Combat Limitation**: Can only shoot while stationary, must stop to fire
- **Mobility Type**: Slow crawling movement between firing positions
- **Weapon System**: Long-range cannon with melee backup capability

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Distance Maintenance**: Keep distance from targets for optimal firing range
2. **Firing Protocol**: Shoot when far away from enemies while stationary
3. **Close-Range Defense**: Spin around and melee if enemies get too close
4. **Damage Adaptation**: Miss at interesting things when damaged, recover after
   few seconds
5. **Death Sequence**: Explode and fling cannon barrel into friendly unit,
   destroying it

## Original Design Documentation

**Based on kick_ass_enemy_design.txt and On_Command_GDD.txt**

This unit documentation has been corrected to match the original design
specifications from the project development notes.

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate threat level relative to current battlefield
  conditions
- **Coordination Protocol**: Determine required squad coordination level for
  effective elimination
- **Equipment Selection**: Choose optimal weapons and equipment for engagement
- **Positioning Strategy**: Establish tactical positioning to maximize
  effectiveness while minimizing exposure

### Recommended Engagement

**Weapon Effectiveness**:

- **[M.A.G. Projectile System](mag-projectile-system)**: Standard effectiveness
  against support units
- **[Nanite Military Systems](nanite-military-systems)**: Enhanced effectiveness
  due to specialized targeting capabilities
- **Squad Coordination**: Important for support elimination

**Communication Requirements**:

- **Unit Identification**: Clear communication of Anchor presence and position
- **Tactical Coordination**: Coordinate squad response based on unit
  capabilities
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate elimination priority relative to other
  battlefield threats

## Strategic Integration

### Battlefield Role

**Primary Function**: Battlefield support and enhancement

**Force Multiplication**: Anchor units enhance effectiveness of other enemy
types through:

- **Tactical Synergy**: Capabilities complement other unit types
- **Resource Management**: Forces squad resource allocation decisions
- **Positioning Pressure**: Influences squad positioning and movement choices
- **Coordination Impact**: Indirectly affects coordination through tactical
  pressure

### Timeline Integration

**ON COMMAND Period Role**: Combat unit developed during resistance warfare
**Technology Evolution**: Specialized systems integrated into peaceful
applications **DODEC Era Legacy**: Technology principles incorporated into
[peaceful reconstruction](dodec-overview) systems
