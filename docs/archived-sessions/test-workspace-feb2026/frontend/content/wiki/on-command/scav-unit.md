## Behavioral Profile

Aerial reconstruction specialist that hides behind cover to rebuild destroyed
droids into weaker operational versions

## Technical Specifications

- **Form Factor**: Flying unit with multitude of limbs for part manipulation
- **Primary Function**: Droid reconstruction from battlefield debris
- **Tactical Behavior**: Hides behind corpses or active enemy units for
  protection
- **Reconstruction Capability**: Creates weaker versions of destroyed droids

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Collection Phase**: Hide behind corpses or active enemy units for
   protection
2. **Reconstruction Work**: Re-assemble destroyed droids into weaker operational
   versions
3. **Projectile Defense**: Throw sharp and blunt droid parts at enemies in range

4. **Death Spiral**: Spin out of control and hit something interesting upon
   destruction

## Original Design Documentation

**Based on kick_ass_enemy_design.txt and On_Command_GDD.txt**

This unit documentation has been corrected to match the original design
specifications from the project development notes.

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate threat level relative to current battlefield
  conditions
- **Coordination Protocol**: Determine required squad coordination level for
  effective elimination
- **Equipment Selection**: Choose optimal weapons and equipment for engagement
