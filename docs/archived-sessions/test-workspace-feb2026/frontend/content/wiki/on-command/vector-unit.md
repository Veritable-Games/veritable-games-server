# Vector

_Agility-Focused Evasion Specialist_

## Overview

Weak but incredibly adept at traversing the environment quickly. Deadlier
variant of the Dredge unit that focuses on agility and evasion while deploying
electronic warfare systems.

**Unit Category**: [Electronic Units](enemy-units-electronic)

## Behavioral Profile

Focuses on damage avoidance while getting close to enemies through superior
environmental navigation, using cover tactically based on damage state.

## Technical Specifications

- **Mobility System**: Incredibly adept at quick environment traversal
- **Lethality Rating**: Deadlier variant of Dredge unit capabilities
- **Durability**: Weak individual unit requiring evasion for survival
- **Tactical Focus**: Close-quarters engagement through superior mobility

## Combat Flow Pattern

1. **Evasion Focus**: Avoid damage while getting close to enemies, darting
   around the map
2. **Cover Utilization**: Use cover as often as possible when undamaged
3. **Aggressive Mode**: When damaged, avoid damage and get close to enemies
   using cover sparingly with maximum aggression
4. **Death Movement**: Die while in motion and collide with interesting things
5. **Bullet Magnet**: Serves as "bullet magnet" attracting NPC projectile fire

## Original Design Documentation

**Based on kick_ass_enemy_design.txt**

Note: The original design focuses on agility and evasion rather than electric
trap deployment. The electric trap capability may be a later addition or
confusion with other electronic warfare systems.

## Tactical Countermeasures

**Squad Response Requirements**:

- **Mobility Tracking**: Anticipate rapid movement patterns and environmental
  navigation
- **Predictive Targeting**: Lead shots to account for high-speed movement
- **Area Denial**: Use positioning to limit Vector's environmental advantages
- **Sustained Fire**: Continuous engagement to overcome evasion capabilities

### Recommended Engagement

**Weapon Effectiveness**:

- **[M.A.G. Projectile System](mag-projectile-system)**: Effective but requires
  predictive targeting
- **[Nanite Military Systems](nanite-military-systems)**: Enhanced tracking
  capabilities for mobile targets
- **Squad Coordination**: Important for tracking and eliminating agile target

**Communication Requirements**:

- **Movement Prediction**: Anticipate Vector's rapid repositioning
- **Sustained Engagement**: Maintain fire pressure to overcome evasion
- **Environmental Awareness**: Track Vector's use of environmental features

## Strategic Integration

### Battlefield Role

**Primary Function**: Electronic warfare through superior mobility and
positioning

**Force Multiplication**: Vector units enhance effectiveness through:

- **Distraction Tactics**: High mobility forces attention and resource
  allocation
- **Positioning Pressure**: Superior navigation creates tactical pressure
- **Evasion Specialization**: Demonstrates advanced movement capabilities
- **Electronic Integration**: Coordinates with other electronic warfare systems

### Timeline Integration

**ON COMMAND Period Role**: Advanced mobility electronic warfare unit
**Technology Evolution**: Agility systems adapted for post-war rapid response
and emergency services **DODEC Era Legacy**: Mobility principles incorporated
into [peaceful reconstruction](dodec-overview) systems
