# Time to Prepare (TTP) System

**Time to Prepare (TTP)** is the strategic planning phase mechanic in ON COMMAND
that allows squads to coordinate, plan, and prepare before engaging in combat
operations.

## System Overview

The TTP system transforms immediate action games into strategic thinking
experiences, emphasizing preparation, coordination, and tactical planning over
reactive gameplay.

## Core Mechanics

### Planning Phase Duration

- **Variable Time Allocation**: TTP duration varies based on mission complexity
  and threat level
- **Democratic Time Management**: Squad members collectively decide how to use
  preparation time
- **Real-Time Coordination**: Planning occurs in real-time with full squad
  participation
- **Pressure Dynamics**: Limited time creates urgency while enabling meaningful
  preparation

### Preparation Activities

- **Route Planning**: Coordinating squad movement paths and positioning
- **Equipment Distribution**: Allocating specialized gear among squad members
- **Role Assignment**: Determining individual responsibilities and
  specializations
- **Contingency Development**: Creating backup plans for various tactical
  scenarios

## Integration with Squad Systems

### 6-Person Team Coordination

The TTP system leverages ON COMMAND's
[[on-command-character-classes|6-person squad structure]]:

- **Parallel Planning**: Multiple squad members can plan different aspects
  simultaneously
- **Expertise Integration**: Specialists contribute knowledge relevant to their
  areas of competence
- **Democratic Decision-Making**: All squad members participate in strategic
  planning
- **Role Optimization**: Planning time allows for optimal character deployment

### Mission Selection Impact

- **Subset Planning**: When deploying fewer than 6 squad members, TTP focuses on
  optimal selection
- **Specialist Prioritization**: Choosing which characters best match mission
  requirements
- **Backup Assignments**: Planning for potential specialist loss during
  operations
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Adjusting plans based on available personnel

## Strategic Applications

### [[strategic-points-system|Strategic Points]] Planning

- **Point Prioritization**: Identifying most valuable strategic positions
- **Capture Coordination**: Planning synchronized approaches to multiple points
- **Defense Assignments**: Allocating personnel to defend captured positions
- **Fallback Routes**: Pre-planning withdrawal paths if point control fails

### [[emplacement-zones-system|Emplacement Zones]] Preparation

- **Construction Planning**: Coordinating EZ placement and construction
  priorities
- **Resource Allocation**: Determining materials and personnel for emplacement
  construction
- **Defensive Integration**: Planning EZ positions to support strategic point
  control
- **Timeline Coordination**: Balancing EZ construction time with operational
  requirements

## Intelligence and Reconnaissance

### Information Gathering

- **Enemy Assessment**: Analyzing opponent capabilities and likely tactics
- **Terrain Analysis**: Understanding battlefield features and tactical
  opportunities
- **Resource Evaluation**: Identifying available equipment and supply
  opportunities
- **Civilian Considerations**: Planning operations to minimize impact on
  non-combatants

### Communication Planning

- **Coordination Protocols**: Establishing communication procedures for
  operations
- **Signal Systems**: Pre-arranged signals for complex tactical maneuvers
- **Backup Communications**: Contingency plans for primary communication failure
- **Information Distribution**: Ensuring all squad members understand
  operational plans

## Non-Lethal Operations Planning

### Humanitarian Considerations

Consistent with ON COMMAND's non-lethal focus:

- **Civilian Protection**: Planning operations to safeguard non-combatant
  populations
- **De-escalation Strategies**: Preparing approaches to resolve conflicts
  without violence
- **Medical Planning**: Coordinating medical support for both allies and
  potential opponents
- **Evacuation Routes**: Planning safe withdrawal options for all parties

### Neutralization Tactics

- **Containment Strategies**: Planning approaches to trap rather than eliminate
  opponents
- **Intimidation Tactics**: Psychological approaches to discourage enemy
  engagement
- **Non-Lethal Equipment**: Coordinating use of stun and disabling technologies
- **Negotiation Preparation**: Planning diplomatic approaches to conflict
  resolution

## Environmental Planning

### Atlas Tether Operations

Planning for complex urban environments within [[atlas-tether|Atlas Tethers]]:

- **Vertical Tactics**: Coordinating movement through multi-level urban
  architecture
- **Civilian Integration**: Planning operations that work around populated areas
- **Infrastructure Preservation**: Avoiding damage to essential city systems
- **Emergency Services**: Coordinating with local emergency and medical services

### Variable Terrain

- **Weather Considerations**: Planning for environmental conditions affecting
  operations
- **Seasonal Factors**: Adjusting tactics based on climate and terrain changes
- **Resource Availability**: Planning based on locally available materials and
  support
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Understanding local customs and avoiding cultural
  conflicts

## Skill Development Through Planning

### Strategic Thinking

- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning to identify tactical opportunities and
  threats
- **Systems Thinking**: Understanding how different tactical elements interact
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating potential outcomes and adjusting plans
  accordingly
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: Developing innovative approaches to tactical
  challenges

### Leadership Development

- **Democratic Leadership**: Learning to guide group decisions without
  domination
- **Delegation Skills**: Effectively distributing responsibilities among squad
  members
- **Communication Mastery**: Clearly conveying complex tactical information
- **Adaptability**: Adjusting leadership style based on situation and squad
  needs

## Integration with Broader ON COMMAND Systems

### [[nanite-technology|Nanite Technology]] Planning

- **Resource Requests**: Coordinating nanite resource allocation for operations
- **Technology Integration**: Planning optimal use of nanite-enhanced equipment
- **Medical Support**: Coordinating nanite medical systems for casualty
  treatment
- **Construction Support**: Planning nanite-assisted construction of tactical
  positions

### Faction Relations

- **Allied Coordination**: Planning joint operations with other Allied Civil
  Preserve forces
- **Enemy Analysis**: Understanding Stellan Liberation Forces tactics and
  adapting accordingly
- **Local Relations**: Planning community engagement and support development
- **Political Considerations**: Understanding broader political implications of
  tactical decisions
