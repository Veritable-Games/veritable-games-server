## INTRODUCTION

There was a time, when we were young, scrappy, and hungry, when fighting for justice brought to mind picket signs, linked arms, and raised
fists. As our daily responsibilities multiply—and the folks who want to push
liberty even further beyond our outstretched fingertips grab more unchecked
power—it’s harder to make it to the front lines. But we also know that’s not
the only way to fight. As we spend our days writing and editing stories
about racial justice (and injustice), we are increasingly struck by all the
ways Black people combat the physical and emotional wages of the system
of White supremacy. Just as there are millions of us fighting, there are
millions of ways to land blows.
The fact is, White supremacy defines our current reality. It is not merely
a belief that to be White is to be better. It is a political, cultural, and
economic system premised on the subjugation of people who are not White.
That subjugation takes on an infinite number of forms and is enforced with
varying degrees of physical violence, mental abuse, and robbery. White
supremacy is the voice in our collective heads that says it makes civilized
sense that one group of people gets to annihilate, enslave, incarcerate,
brainwash, torture, sterilize, breed, and terrorize other people. White
supremacy establishes, upholds, and normalizes hierarchy based on the
premise that the less Black you are the closer you are to God.
We live in a country where law enforcement officers kill Black children
and call them “thugs,” the mainstream media calls neo-Nazis the “alt-right,”
and referencing “the African Americans” in discussions about urban crime
is a sufficient credential to put a third-rate reality television personality in
the White House. But the encouraging reality is this: Black people are
working each day to inch us closer to collective freedom. We contain
multitudes, and we are hammering at issues as varied and intersectional as
police violence and body image and reproductive justice and lack of
inclusion in the technology sector.
We’re fascinated by those who resist and create despite the obstacles
produced by White supremacy and its lackeys: sexism, homophobia,
disenfranchisement, transphobia, colorism, ableism, and more. We wrote
this book to document the people, from the unsung to the famous, who are
doing good work right where they stand, fighting causes both sexy and
pedestrian. There’s the leader of a religious movement that holds up issues
that impact queer people of color, the cartoonist who applies the Black punk
aesthetic to the hard work of silencing White supremacists, the cofounders
of a movement that made the world consider the worth of Black lives, and
dozens of other freedom fighters who share their work and their dreams for
a future that doesn’t thrive on anti-Blackness.
Many people—both here and abroad—are considering the fragility of
their freedom for the first time, and thousands of the newly “woke” need
help with defining their own version of activism. Fortunately for us all,
Black people can provide the key.
Black Americans have made a cottage industry of surviving, resisting,
and fighting. From staging insurrections after being used as the literal
capital that bankrolled the birth of this nation to arguing before the US
Supreme Court in the face of codified racial segregation via Brown v. Board
of Education of Topeka, to clapping back at the microaggressions that
threaten to chip away at our humanity each day, we always find a way to
stand rooted in the face of oppression. You want to talk about patriots? We
honor the principles of democracy at every turn, even when the people
charged with implementing those principles don’t honor us. This ain’t new
to us. Whether we’re singing, sitting, marching, researching, prosecuting,
creating, laughing, studying, organizing, dreaming, building wealth, or
drawing on spirit, we battle life-threatening forces as a matter of course.
Why should this moment be any different?

## What This Book Isn’t

Although we sought out a diverse group of contributors, this collection
isn’t exhaustive: it does not apply an international lens, and it doesn’t
include Black “conservatives.” We know that anyone who is truly interested
and invested in dismantling the intricate system of White supremacy will
learn from this book, but it’s not here to tell you what to do, and it’s not
written with anyone but Black folks in mind (see no “explanatory commas”
in the next section). It’s also important to know that we began working on
this book long before the election of the forty-fifth president of the United
States. The acts of resistance it chronicles are not defined by the actions of
one man, but by the collective longing for a justice that has so far eluded us.

## What This Book Is

     How We Fight White Supremacy is a curated, multidisciplinary
collection that serves as a showcase for some of our most powerful thinkers
and doers. It starts in the middle of a Black-ass conversation; you won’t find
any explanatory commas about our cultural mores here. Speaking of which,
to reflect the permanence of our resistance, we organized the book
according to Black conventional and contemporary wisdom, with chapters
like “Laugh to Keep from Crying” (our gallows humor), “Get in Formation”
(grassroots organizing), and “Love Me or Leave Me Alone” (how we love
ourselves whole). Each chapter starts with our take on why a particular
category of resistance is integral to the fight and ends with our (very)
personal reflections on the matter. Seriously, this collection has everything:
thoughtful interviews, “am I really crying right now?” essays, ridiculously
relatable fine art, unexpected profiles, crying laughing emoji face funny
fiction, reflections from everyday people on their everyday resistance, get
hype playlists, and more—all breathe in these pages.
     But most of all, this is a book about freedom dreams. We’re well aware
of the problems we’re buried beneath. We can feel the weight of them on
our limbs, the heft of them in our abdomens as our second brains gnaw on
the indignity of it all. But what does it look like for Black people to claw
our way to fresh air? What does freedom feel like? How does it taste on the
tongue? For some folks in this book, it feels like raising kids who gleefully
take up space for themselves. For others, it looks like providing the tools we
need to triumph over race-based trauma. There’s the pastor who envisions a
day when following his radical, dark-skinned Jesus who always sides with
the dispossessed will lift us out of this hole, and the organizer who can
almost smell the sharp aroma of reforming the nation’s political system.
And we can’t forget the professor who dreams of the day when we can bring
our full selves to every table.
     Although this book is not prescriptive—if we had a magic button we
could press to end this nightmare, we would have leaned on that bitch long
ago—it is thoughtful and hopeful and bursting with agency. In immersing
ourselves in the work of others, we can define and refine our own work; in
reveling in the freedom dreams of our beloved, we can labor to make them
lucid. The reality is this: if we don’t make time to close our eyes, breathe
deeply, push beyond the binds we’re in, and visualize a day when they don’t
exist, we can never truly be free.
Our hope is that by the time you read the last page, you will have your
own strategy for making our collective freedom dream a reality. We’ll see
you on the other side.

## GET IN FORMATION

Although Second Wave feminism declared that “the personal is political” and Black feminists did the work of expanding “the personal” to include
people who were not White, straight, or middle-class, the idea that “I’m not
free until we all are free” has always been a major one for us. This explains
how both Blacks who were born free and those who became free acted as
conductors on the Underground Railroad at great personal risk. How Black
folks throughout the African Diaspora toiled to defeat the murderous system
of South African apartheid. It’s our way of thinking, our cultural value, that
provides the scaffolding for our drive toward universal equity.
As the Combahee River Collective put it in “A Black Feminist
Statement” in 1977:
The most general statement of our politics at the present time would be that we are
actively committed to struggling against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class
analysis and practice based upon the fact that the major systems of oppression are
interlocking. The synthesis of these oppressions creates the conditions of our lives.
As Black women we see Black feminism as the logical political movement to
combat the manifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face.…
        We might use our position at the bottom, however, to make a clear leap into
revolutionary action. If Black women were free, it would mean that everyone else
would have to be free, since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all
the systems of oppression.
This belief that collective action brings about collective solutions
underpins organizing in social movements. We are the informal and selfdescribed strategists who refine tactics passed down from our previous tries
at liberation, and we are the patient participants in the slow-going project of
freedom. At our best and most holistic, we act as advocates for every Black
person, regardless of gender, sexuality, class, immigration status, record of
criminal charges, education level, quirk, or kink. As long as you don’t act all
the way up and out, our instinct is to claim you. This is what pulls activists
out of bed each morning—the way we instinctively understand that “Black
Lives Matter” is a rallying cry, not a threat to the humanity of others.
There’s a reason you use your fists and not your individual fingertips to
fight. From one of the minds behind Black Lives Matter, to a formerly
incarcerated man working to restore the voting rights of others, to the
woman who first encouraged survivors to say, “Me too,” the organizers
featured in this chapter are knockout artists.
Patrisse Khan-Cullors on Why “We’ve Got to Tell a Different

## Story about Blackness”

Patrisse Khan-Cullors is best known for cofounding Black Lives Matter
(BLM) in 2013 in response to the exoneration of George Zimmerman, the
White self-appointed neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Florida, who
followed seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin as he walked home from the
store and fatally shot him. But Khan-Cullors was a Los Angeles–based artist
and organizer long before then. Her award-winning work with the Labor
Community Strategy Center and her performance piece “Stained: An
Intimate Portrayal of State Violence” were early shots fired in a career that
has focused on making the lives of Black people truly matter. Her first book,
When They Call You a Terrorist, was released in 2018. Here she talks to
Akiba about the genesis of her community organizing.
How did you get into organizing?
Aww, the good old days. Let’s see. I grew up in Van Nuys, a workingclass suburb of LA made up of mostly undocumented Latino immigrants,
some Black folks, and some poor White people.
I was very concerned about the environment in elementary school and
middle school. I think I adopted a whale in elementary school, and I was
concerned with animals going extinct. At the time, the environmental
movement had the best stronghold on messaging around organizing and
activism.
I learned my actual organizing skills at a social justice camp up in the
mountains of California when I was sixteen. The camp was run by National
Conference for Community and Justice. We had seven days of training in a
“tolerance” curriculum. But I wanted an action component to that. At one
point during my training as a youth leader, I asked a group I was working
with, “Do you take on the police?” They said, “No, we’re an environmental
justice group.” I said, “Okay, I’ll take it.”
Still, no matter how much I tell people I’ve been a skilled strategist for
fourteen or fifteen years, people don’t see it. I think it’s because I’m a
woman, am Black, and it’s a more exciting thing to imagine, “Oh, you
popped up out of nowhere!”
People don’t understand that organizing isn’t going online and cussing
people out or going to a protest and calling something out. That’s the most
visible shit; we’re not putting our boring-ass meetings on social media.
How do you define an organizer versus an activist?
Organizers are strategists. We are a part of producing and building the
campaign. Activists are showing up to the things that organizers plan,
signing the petitions, going on social [media] to promote the action.
Sometimes organizers are activists as well—they can be out front and work
behind the scenes.
Can you talk about the importance of telling your own story?
As Black Lives Matter—the brand of BLM—grew, it didn’t follow us.
God forbid Black women are behind something huge. So I made an
executive decision when the Melissa Harris-Perry show did a panel about
BLM without inviting me or [cofounders Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi]. It
was like, “Nah, that’s not going to work this time. We’re Black women; we
know the story of being erased.”
We’re forty years in and just now really talking about Ella Baker. That’s
no dis to MLK, but goddamn. Hundreds of Black women did work for the
March on Washington. And after women did that work, [male organizers]
decided that women weren’t going to speak. So I decided that this time
patriarchy was not going to rule the land. Or at least we were going to
compete with it.
Why do you think patriarchy is still so appealing to us?
We are wired for patriarchy. It’s how our bodies work. It’s not even in
our minds. It’s in our belief system. We still believe in Black men more than
Black women. That’s how you get a man as a “leader” of BLM. At least
MLK actually was a leader! We need a culture shift.
How do you cope with being forward-facing when people take
shots at your work?
This work takes an extreme amount of restraint, and it’s very lonely, very
isolating. Sometimes I want to go on social media and go the hell off, but
then I go call somebody. It takes community support, a commitment to
what’s bigger. And I try not to feel sorry for myself. I literally have a
centering practice, Jordan somatics. It looks like being able to wake up and
sit on the edge of my bed, standing up and taking deep breaths and healing
into the deepest parts of me. I remember that I’m human and doing the best
that I can. I keep it in perspective by keeping my oldest homies close,
people who aren’t a part of the movement. That gives me grounding and
perspective.
What makes you proud about the work of BLM?
That we did something different than I would say the old guard did. We
were talking about trans Black people, about police violence against Black
women. We were looking at harm and violence inside of the Black
community. For us, every victim is special and important, no matter their
past. We’ve got to tell a different story about Blackness.

## Redemption Song

For Christopher Rashad Green, organizing is about redemption.
He was sixteen years old the first time he was arrested.
“At fifteen, I was an honor roll student attending a college prep program
on the campus of Rutgers University. On my sixteenth birthday, I was
locked up. Six months. That’s how fast it happened,” says the Plainfield,
New Jersey, native. “Looking back now, I still ask, How did that happen?
Some of the members of my clique turned south, and I went south with
them. Trying to fit in, I was making poor decisions, shooting heroin. And
then I was locked up. Altogether, I’ve put about fifteen years in on this
installment plan.”
After more than a dozen years in and out of prisons in New Jersey, New
York, Texas, and Virginia for a series of addiction-related infractions, he’d
had enough.
On May 20, 2010, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, police took
Green into custody, and he decided that it would be his last time behind
bars. “I can’t explain it, but within forty-eight hours I just had this resolve. I
just knew that I would never come back,” Green says of his last three-year
bid. “I said to myself, My reentry program starts now. I’m not going to wait
to get to the end of my bid, I’m going to start it right now.”
And so he did.
He connected with mentors, joined a rehab program, started journaling
—anything to prepare himself for the task of getting out and staying out. As
he worked on himself, one word kept coming back to him: “service.”
“I would only be successful in life if I served other people. That was the
message I got. I didn’t hear any voices or anything like that. But that, within
my studying, that was the word that jumped out,” he said. “I tried to dissect
it, and it came to me. I would never be successful, anywhere in life, until I
figured out a way to serve.”
These days, Green is an organizer with the progressive nonprofit New
Virginia Majority. He first attended a meeting in the fall of 2015, just as he
was toying with the idea of getting his voting rights restored. “I hooked up
with New Virginia Majority, and they were addressing the restoration of
rights. It was just a perfect fit,” he says. “From that point on, I became
pretty much the face of restoration of rights for New Virginia Majority.”
After volunteering for two years, he was hired as an organizer, focusing
primarily on voter registration and restoration of rights, which means he
does everything from knocking on doors to lobbying the state’s General
Assembly members. “The role seems like it was carved out for me,” says
Green, who is now based in Richmond, Virginia. “It keeps me alive.”
He sees his biggest task as helping Black people in his community push
back against the idea that they don’t matter. “So many people, when we try
to register them, say, ‘It’s not going to change anything. My vote’s not going
to matter.’ And I say, ‘No, it does matter, brother. Because it’s not just about
voting. It’s about being involved.’ I share my story with them, try to
encourage them to jump in,” he says. “And then look what happened here in
Virginia last year: the balance of power in the General Assembly was

## decided by one vote. One vote.”

Green estimates that he has helped thousands of Black people regain
their right to participate in the democratic process. And on August 15, 2016,
he secured his own. “I got to register and vote for the first time in almost
thirty years,” says Green, who is fifty-eight. “When I first started working
with New Virginia Majority, I heard this term: ‘political currency.’ Your
vote is political currency. That kind of struck me as like, ‘Wow, my voice is
like currency. Let me get my rights back.’ What could I lose for doing it?
It’s my right. I’m a taxpaying citizen. I did my time.”
Green’s organizing work makes him feel like a new man. “I’m really
trying to redeem myself. There’s no excuse for all the bad things I did over
the years. But as my people say, ‘That’s old, that’s done. That’s the old
Christopher. This is the new brother Christopher here.’”

## The Makings of #MeToo: A Q+A with Tarana Burke

Tarana Burke is a veteran organizer, writer, and survivor of childhood
sexual abuse. She has worked for nonprofits around the country, including
Selma’s National Voting Rights Museum and Institute, Philadelphia’s Art
Sanctuary, and New York City’s Girls for Gender Equity. She’s also an
accidental celebrity.
      Burke became famous in late 2017 after investigative reports confirmed
sexual violence accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
That moment—which saw the toppling of Weinstein as well as TV hosts
Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, among many others—didn’t have a name until
the White actress Alyssa Milano suggested that all survivors should tweet
“me too.” What Milano soon found out, owing to a Black feminist Twitter
outcry, was that Burke had founded a #MeToo movement in 2006 as a
multiplatform initiative that provides refuge for Black survivors of sexual
abuse and exploitation.
      Milano gave Burke the credit she deserved, mainstream media caught
on, and the organizer ran with the whole thing. Burke has been on
billboards and on CNN. She has dropped the New Year’s Eve ball in New
York City and been named a Time Person of the Year. And she has forced
the influential Tom Joyner Morning Show to stop playing R. Kelly’s music.
      Akiba sat down with Burke for a candid dialogue about movementbuilding.
Let’s start with Tarana as a youth organizer.
      I started when I became a member of the 21st Century Youth Leadership
Movement, in Selma, Alabama. It was founded by people who came from
the Civil Rights, Black Power, and labor movements. They wanted to make
sure there was another generation to carry on their legacy. So we went to a
summer camp and took all kinds of classes. We were also expected to do
something during the school year. The first thing I ever organized around
was Donald Trump.
Really?
      Yeah, via the Central Park jogger case. Isn’t that some full-circle shit?
It is! How old were you?
      It was spring 1989, so I was fifteen. Yusef [Salaam, one of the Central
Park Five] was dating a friend of mine. She came to the program, like,
“They arrested my boyfriend, and I know he didn’t do it.”
When the story hit the newspapers, it was ridiculous. Donald Trump
took out that full-page ad in the four major New York papers—the Daily
News, Times, Post, and Newsday—calling [the accused] animals and calling
for their heads. He really doubled down on this notion of the oversexed
Black male out here preying on innocent White women.
So what did you do?
We held a protest in front of the New York Daily News, and we wrote
letters to the editors of all the major newspapers. We were trying to make
the point that they were criminalizing Black youth when there were plenty
of examples of us doing positive things. The other point was that Donald
Trump was racist.
Where were you raised?
In the South Bronx, not far from Yankee Stadium. My grandfather was a
self-professed Garveyite: he believed in Marcus Mosiah Garvey. I was
raised Catholic, but he told me that the only thing he wanted me to do was
read a history book alongside the Bible so that I could learn what was
actually going on in the world.
What did you learn?
When I was in seventh grade, he gave me They Came before Columbus
and Roots. I was conflicted because I was a very good Catholic girl. At the
same time, my mother had participated in the Black Power Movement in the
’70s and was a Womanist in the early ’80s because of Alice Walker.
That sounds like a well-rounded education!
It was. On the one hand, you had my mother with all of this Black
feminist literature, and then you had my grandfather, who used to take me
down to 125th Street to buy cassette tapes of John Henrick Clarke. We
always had a birthday cake for Martin Luther King’s and Malcolm X’s
birthdays. My granddaddy was like, “We don’t need no goddamned United
States of America to tell us when to celebrate our people!”
[laughs] So you were primed for Black activism.
Yeah, I was primed. But in some ways, my mother and my grandfather
didn’t [show] me how to make what they taught me useful for the
community. I was a really conversant twelve-year-old, but until I found 21st
Century, I didn’t have a way to put that into action.
How did you find out about this Selma-based movement as a kid
from the Bronx?
21st Century’s New York chapter came through an organization called
Jobs for Youth. I was the little assistant in the office. I made $3.10 an hour.
One day the head of the office said, “Hey, you wanna go to Washington,
DC?” and gave me a flyer. I took it home to my mother and asked,
“Mommy, can I go to DC?” She was like, “How much it cost?” I said, “It’s
free!” If that trip had been $50, I might not have been a 21st Century leader!
Ah, the trip to DC was such a staple!
Yes! So a bunch of us go to DC. It’s like eighty rambunctious-ass New
York City high school kids. We get off at the 4-H center in Chevy Chase,
Maryland, which I thought was a joke. I was like, “How does Chevy Chase
have a whole city?”
Anyway, we get off the bus and see these Alabama-ass kids singing and
dancing. They were joyous fucking kids. And we were some ornery New
York kids asking, “What the fuck are they so happy for?”
So what did you do there?
We did a three-day leadership program. Although I was still crotchety, I
was low-key, like, I love this! So when I got back to New York, I helped
start our chapter. 21st Century is where I first learned that fighting White
supremacy didn’t always have to look like what it looked like in history
books. We had songs with lyrics like, “We are the ones we’ve been waiting
for!” It was all geared toward us working for the community that we wanted
to live in, in spite of White supremacy.
You were sold!
     Yes. I became a complete and utter convert. It was like being in a
sorority, and it was an escape from dealing with sexual abuse. I didn’t have
to confront my own demons. Becoming a fighter and then an organizer
allowed me to shield myself from this part of my life that was really torture.
So how did you go from being a 21st Century leader to founding
the #MeToo movement?
     The concept of “me too” had been bubbling under the surface for a long
time. As an adult, working for 21st Century, we would have community
meetings, and I was seeing [evidence of sexual abuse] everywhere. I was
trying to figure out how to talk about it so it didn’t pathologize Black people
or demonize the South. But living in Selma in particular, it was so
pervasive. We had elders naming community problems, but not sexual
abuse. I knew I wasn’t the only one who had been abused. I was like, “What
criteria do you have to meet before something [rises] to the level of a
community fucking problem?” A big part of this had to do with how James
Bevel, the civil rights leader, was found to be a serial abuser. Before he
died, he was convicted of molesting one of his fourteen daughters. What’s
missing from the stories on the internet is how he was protected by the civil
rights community. Some of my elders went mute when it came to sexual
violence. They even allowed him to interact with kids. Even the accusation
alone should have been enough. The adults should have said, “We don’t
know if it’s true or not, but we can’t have you around our young people.”
Their silence was it for me.
That is so awful.
     I was being retraumatized. So that’s what sparked #MeToo. My elders
and people who I respected did not take sexual violence seriously, but they
had also given me all the skills I needed to do it myself.
Because the movement has a Hollywood component, I’ve heard
whisperings among Black folks that #MeToo has been
Whitewashed. How do you deal with that?
     What I’ve been saying to Black people when I’m traveling around is that
it’s not enough for y’all to celebrate me as an individual. Black people are
not responding from that place of, “This is ours, a movement that started for
us.” We’re still whispering. We are private. And we are still allowing this

## narrative that Black people can’t say “me too.”

      I feel like we’re still trying to protect us, whoever us is. I don’t think we
actually want CNN to do an exposé on abuse in the Black community.
Somebody would be like, “But they fired Soledad O’Brien!”
      It’s always going to be like that. Look what happened when [editor-inchief] Kierna [Mayo] put that picture of the Huxtables under broken glass
on the cover of Ebony. [Black] people lost their fucking minds. People were
saying, “You can’t do that!” like it was a betrayal. And because of all of the
uproar, we couldn’t have an honest conversation about sexual violence and
Black men, or the way that we idolize fictional characters and protect them
over human beings. At this point, you can get a large group of people to
agree about R. Kelly [being a pedophile and sexual abuser], but that’s still a
debate in our community.
      We have to fight White supremacy and [how] it permeates our lives as
Black people in America. But we’ve also been co-opted by it. I know I
sound probably like my grandfather now, but we doing the work of the
White folks ourselves. [laughs]
So let’s talk about what you started. I remember you having a
“me too” curriculum, a website, and T-shirts.
      Yes. That work was focused on young people I was working with in
Philadelphia. A friend and I cofounded an organization called Just BE Inc.,
that came out of a rites of passage program that we had previously created
called Jendayi Aza. [laughs] It meant, “You are powerful. Give thanks.” We
put girls through twenty-one weeks of training. It was modeled after
pledging a [Black] sorority with a little bit of Girl Scouts and African rites
of passage. The girls loved it. We did it with high school–age girls for two
years. Then a middle school asked us to create something for their girls.
So how did you get to “me too”?
      When we first started our program, we didn’t include sexual violence in
the curriculum. But the girls were always coming and telling us some new
shit. We found out that one of our seventh-graders was “dating” a twentyone-year-old man. We chased his ass away. And then we had another girl
who had been left back so she was fourteen in the seventh grade. She had
one child and was pregnant again. We found out she’d had her first baby
when she was either twelve or thirteen, at the hands of her mother’s
boyfriend.
That’s a lot, Tarana.
She and another little girl who I met in Selma were two of the saddest
cases I ever had. The girl in Selma used to fight all the time. She was in
foster care because her mom’s boyfriend had molested her and she got
pregnant. She had the baby at twelve or thirteen and she and her child were
in foster care together. When I met her, she was fourteen and pregnant again
at the hands of another adult who assaulted her. These girls were so, so, so
vulnerable.
So how did you deal with all of this given your own trauma?
After a few years, I needed to sit down. But back to the program: One
night, I wrote out all of the concepts that became “me too.” Then my
partner and I built a workshop around it. We would start with language,
giving the girls legal definitions for what they were facing, because they just
didn’t know. Most people don’t know.
No, they don’t.
The next part involved [the sexual assault stories of] Gabrielle Union,
Mary J. Blige, Fantasia, Queen Latifah, Missy Elliot, and Oprah. The
workshop would start with an icebreaker conversation that would lead to me
saying, “I’m a survivor,” and telling them parts of my story. Our acronym
was SAAE, which stood for Sexual Assault, Abuse, and Exploitation. We
wanted a way to name exploitation in that gray area that people don’t really
deal with.
So after you shared parts of your story, what would you do?
We had pasted a picture of each of the celebrities I named on a sheet of
black paper and wrote the words “me too.” On the other side, we’d pasted a
[stock photo] of a Black girl that we’d pulled off of the internet, wrote “me
too” under her picture, and added some statistics. While the girls looked at
the side of the paper with the girl’s picture on it, we would tell a story. Then
we’d say, “Turn your page over.” And the girls would be like, “Oh, it’s
Oprah!” It was so dramatic, but it worked for kids.
After going through that process, we would ask, “What do you think
about when you think of Oprah?” They would write a whole bunch of
[positive] words like “smart,” “rich,” and “pretty.” Then we’d ask them what
words they thought of when they heard the phrase “Black girls.” And for the
most part, they’d write down negatives: “loud,” “nappy head,” “ghetto.”
I know it’s problematic in some ways to base it around celebrities
because I don’t know what their healing journey was. But what they
represented to those girls was a different life. We were trying to show them
that there’s a trajectory toward healing and joy. We wanted them to
understand that trauma was part of their journey, but not where they lived.
To make sure the entire program wasn’t depressing, we used music and arts
and crafts and we took them on trips.
So did it ever get personal?
The way we ended the workshop was to give each girl in the class a
sticky note and ask her to write down three things she’d learned. Then we’d
say, “And if anybody wants to share more, you can write that on this piece
of paper too. You can say ‘me too.’ You can write down your phone number
or email address if you need help.” That was our way of making sure
nobody was singled out. We also handed out resource sheets with the
number of a local crisis center and counselors they could call. At the end of
the first workshop, we collected all of the slips of paper and gave each girl a
hug. There were about thirty-five girls in the class. When my partner and I
got back to our room, we dumped all of those folded-up pieces of paper out
of a manila envelope. There were like twenty-five “me toos” in there. My
partner and I sat down and we cried and cried and cried.
Okay, so, how do you take care of yourself while you do this
work?
[laughs] I feel like I don’t. I mean, I do and I don’t. Early on, I just felt
like this was the price I had to pay and that I should just soldier on.
Eventually my partner and I stopped working together, so it was literally just
me doing these workshops. Then I had to put it down because it was a lot to
handle.
So you just said that you “do and don’t” take care of yourself. In
what ways do you take care of yourself?
The way I take care of myself in a bigger sense is the same way I take
care of myself as a survivor, which is, I have to rejigger my thinking. I spent
most of my life hyperfocused on the fact that I had been through these
things. I was so protective of my brain and my body that I was always
thinking of how to stay safe. That meant learning how to not think about the
shit that happened. But I was still in a fucked-up place.
How did you change this?
When [my daughter] Kaia was born, I was panicked. I was like, “Okay, I
gotta think of something better than this.” When I found out I was having a
girl, I became obsessed with the idea of crafting a world where this child
has access to joy. People always say she’s a great kid and ask me what I did.
I tell them that I was incredibly intentional. I’ve failed in a lot of ways, and
failed to protect her in some ways. But in terms of who she was as a person,
it became really, really important to me from pregnancy on that she knew
joy in her life. The only way I could figure out how to do that was to change
my own life into one that would lead into the joy.
Okay, Oprah!
[laughs] With survivors of all kinds of things, it becomes such a part of
your identity that you almost feel uncomfortable without it. Unless we are
intentional about retraining our brains, we can end up leaning into the
trauma because it’s what we know.
So what did you do specifically? Did you have a technique you
used?
My overthinking Virgo brain was like, There’s gotta be a solution! I
need to understand how to do this differently. So say I had a great day. I
would think, This is wonderful! I’m so happy today! But then, when I had a
minute of quiet, a memory of the trauma would come back. And so I would
say to myself, This is not who you are! The ball and chain would come out,
and I would be like, Get back to being this other thing! That became the
routine, remembering who I actually am. Kaia became the touchstone.
How did that hold up when you were working with the young
survivors?
Well, the kids became the other reason why I had to do things differently.
I used to think, I’m already a lost cause, but let me help y’all get there so
somebody can survive. But kids see through that. That’s when I knew I had
to practice. I read self-help and affirmation books and wrote stuff down on
sticky notes and put them on the mirror. And I would stand in front of the

## mirror every day and say, “I love myself!”

So you talked yourself out of negative thinking? That’s amazing.
Not really. I also felt like it was bullshit when I was saying it. I think I’m
too much of an asshole to really believe some of that shit. But then I
realized that it wasn’t just me being a pessimist. There just wasn’t enough
there to help me.
What ultimately happened?
This remains part of the work of #MeToo. What drove me to healing was
that I didn’t want to give these kids empty platitudes. Ultimately, I had to
find something that was going to fill me when I wasn’t in 21st Century,
doing Just Be, or whatever else. Do you know what I’m saying?
Yes. I know what you’re saying.
I wrote in a joy journal for a while. I would document what process I
went through to feel joy because when I felt like shit, I needed something to
refer back to.
One last question: did you study child development?
No. Political science. [laughs]
Well, okay. [laughs]
That’s the reason why it took me so long to do this work with both feet
in. I felt comfortable with leadership development because I had come from
21st Century and had been through training programs. But I was hesitant
about the #MeToo work because I didn’t want to mess up these kids. I’m not
a social worker.
But in the end, I just forged ahead based on what I needed at their age
and what I saw as their needs. They needed attention, somebody to make
them understand their sense of self-worth despite whatever happened to
them. And they needed to understand that there is possibility beyond this
place. You don’t have to study nothing to do that.
I fight White supremacy with my money by boycotting businesses that
    discriminate against people of color not only through how they treat
      customers of color, but in the products they choose to carry, the
    politics they support, and the way they treat their employees of color.

## Think Globally, Act Locally: A Q+A with Tef Poe

St. Louis rapper, activist, and writer Kareem “Tef Poe” Jackson was
already a community activist when Darren Wilson, a Ferguson, Missouri,
White police officer, fatally shot eighteen-year-old Michael Brown. Brown’s
killing—and the fact that authorities allowed his bleeding corpse to lie in
the street for hours—pushed area people to protest daily. They were met
with police, tanks, tear gas, and rubber bullets.
Tef was among the cadre of young organizers who made up the Ferguson
movement. In 2015, he cofounded Hands Up United, a local organization
that offers tech and small-business training, the free Books and Breakfast
Program, healing circles, and spaces for political dialogues.
When Akiba interviewed Tef in November 2017, he and the movement
were in a different place. He was in his second year at Harvard University as
a Nasir Jones Hiphop Fellow, and the local movement had splintered. Tef is
a self-described revolutionary and revealed himself to be a young Black
man with one foot in the movement and the other in the streets of St. Louis.
Why do you put such a strong emphasis on local organizing?
It’s important because, when you look at history, it’s really the most
effective. When street gangs organize a truce, that’s local organizing. Single
mothers leaning on each other for resources is local organizing. All too
often, we expect organizing to be this grand type of thing. The “we” in this
scenario is the more academic, financially stable people that run the
nonprofit sector. They intellectualize the issues and have grown into the face
of the movement, and that would include myself sometimes. There is a
disconnect between the people that do this professionally and the people
who do this to live.
It can be difficult for people who aren’t indigenous to an area or
who are poor to organize without money, though.
I’m not against the nonprofit sector. But I’m thinking of what it’s
actually going to take to liberate Black folks in America. We use the word
“revolution” all the time, but the fulfillment isn’t going to come through the
nonprofit sector. It hasn’t for the last thirty to forty years. It’s like, when
somebody gets killed by the police. We see mass mobilizations that come
through the nonprofit sector that are usually more docile and less about a
long-term stance of revolutionary conflict with the people we deem as our
enemies. There has to be a space for more radical voices. We also have to
trust the creativity of poor people.
How did Ferguson affect how you think about organizing?
I’m in a weird space after Ferguson. Before, I believed more in the
power of legislation. I believed in political power with a voice at the table. I
still believe we need to be at the table, but I’ve sat down with FBI and
Department of Justice folks and police chiefs [and] the next day I’m getting
arrested by these people. Literally, one day I went to a meeting with [law
enforcement officials] and the very next day they killed a boy. I got arrested
after they killed somebody!
Are you still active in Hands Up United?
Very much. Hands Up is coming up on three years in existence. We’re
reassessing what we’re going to be. We spent most of 2017 trying to stay
out of jail because a lot of the charges that we had accumulated during the
Ferguson actions came to knock on our doors. They might have been petty
cases, but the state wanted to push each and every one of them. We spent a
lot of energy, money, and time trying to stay out of jail.
Talk about what Hands Up does.
Our Books and Breakfast Program has served more than twenty
thousand people. We’ve given out over twelve thousand books and
graduated three classes of Black technologists ages fifteen to thirty-five that
we pulled off the streets and taught how to code and build websites for
Black businesses. We started a food and clothing pantry. That gave us a
different ability to show up in the community. We can show up and tell the
shooters like, “Yo, today we’re out here giving away this food. There won’t
be no shooting from this time to this time.” If we were to come to that
community with just a clipboard, they may not necessarily listen.
You talk a lot about being poor and what that means in the
movement. I’m interested in hearing more about class.
Not every Black person in America is poor, but they still Black. That
carries its own type of mental, spiritual, and physical trauma because we
have to rely on capitalism to, essentially, grant us our freedom papers. But
poor folks are the most marginalized. If we’re gonna have a revolution, it’s
gonna come through them first. Those are the people that are already
shooting. They’re already living with socialist values whether they know it
or not. We just have to figure out how to turn it into something more
substantial.
A fundamental problem that I’ve observed is that some of our
organizing promotes toxic masculinity among Black men under
the guise of taking care of them. How do you address that?
I think we have to lead by example. I don’t shy away from the fact that
women are soldiers. When we’re going into these ’hoods, we’re working
with poor women for the most part. I struggle with the fact that a lot of
brothers use negative language toward women. I’ve had conversations where
I’ve lost friends. At the same time, I have an obligation to meet people
where they’re at.
How do you do that? Pushing political stances in interpersonal
relationships can be so complicated.
I don’t think that we can throw away humans if we’re claiming to be in
the revolutionary space. I’ve met brothers fresh out of prison who are like,
“Yo, I want to be a part of the revolution, how’s it going down?” They are
comfortable because they can just be real. But there is some homophobia,
sexism, and patriarchy involved. Some [movement] people go, “Fuck them.
Forget them.” But they just got out of jail! We gotta address them with love.
Some of my friends in the movement have died and we weren’t together
because of them saying shit like, “Fuck these bitches. I don’t like these
hoes.” I felt strongly about not being aligned with them when they passed. I
felt as if I had shifted myself away from those brothers into a political body
that didn’t embrace me and my identity. When I’d go to the meetings, I
would be the only straight man in the room. So what that tells me is that
[this movement] was not willing to struggle with people that don’t agree
with us, even amongst ourselves.
Talk more about straight masculinity within a movement that is
very steeped in Black feminism and queerness.
I am a person who is actively trying to purge myself of toxic masculine
ways. I’m trying to show up not as an ally, but a straight up coconspirator
with radical Black feminists.… I also will self-identify as an artist before I
self-identify as being a Black man. That’s important to me. I’m going to use
the art, and I’m going to be in the art in every capacity of my existence. I
am a Black man, but I’m a lot more than that as well.
    I fight White supremacy by reminding myself and everyone I can that
      race is fallacy, a divide-and-conquer strategy that will kill us all.

## —Hank Willis Thomas, artist

## QUESTION, ANSWERED

Neither of us identifies as an organizer, but we’re really interested in
what makes people join movements and the groups that propel them. Here

## we each answer the question: “Are you a joiner?”

## Akiba

    People have often, as a compliment, called me an activist because I
strive to create ways for people of color to say important things to one
another and the rest of the world. But I deny this identity because it is not an
informed assessment of my personality.
    I am the child born in the mid-’70s of Philadelphia Black nationalists.
Although my family has been improvisational and expansive in its activism,
I somehow internalized the message that a narrow set of behaviors
constitutes “real work.” These behaviors are of the ready-to-die or at least
ready-to-seriously-suffer variety. And no matter what anyone has said since
I heard at a young age that real revolutionaries had to be ready to subsist on
rats and pigeons while hiding out in a sewer, my soul just can’t leave purism
alone.
    Without the drama and machismo of enforcing Black revolutionary
purity, I can say that I believe that the most effective activism doesn’t
happen without committing to something besides your paid work, sticky
social media posts, and private acts of service. Practically speaking, and
what I believe so far, is that you should join an organization that has agreedupon values, transparent ways to resolve conflict, applied codes of conduct,
political education, credible leadership, and a decent legal defense fund.
    I get these (not-that-revelatory) ideas from years of observing how
change works through journalism. On a personal level, I have come to this
conclusion after people I believed in acted a complete fool and fucked up
what could have been a good thing.
In a piece that she was kind enough to allow me to edit at Colorlines, the
Black feminist scholar Barbara Ransby made a cogent argument for joining
groups even as today’s decentralized movements spread through social
media. In a June 2015 piece called “Ella Taught Me: Shattering the Myth of
the Leaderless Movement,” Ransby wrote:
    In my thirty years of working in many different groups, campaigns, and
    movements, I have been a part of efforts, not always successful, to strike the
balance between mass mobilizing and organization-building; between inclusivity
and accountability; and between strategic actions and spontaneous ones. Groups
I’ve worked with have formed rotating steering and coordinating committees
instead of electing officers. They’ve met regularly and devised ways for there to be
lots of talking, learning, processing, and thinking out loud together.
Communication was always key and accountability has been crucial.
          I have found that without organizations, coalitions, and leadership teams, there
is no collective strategy or accountability. An independent or freelance activist may
share their opinion, and it may be an informed one, but if these words are not
spoken in consultation or conversation with people on the ground, they are limited
as a representation of a movement’s thinking and work.
At the time of writing this, Ransby was reflecting on the work of Black
Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100, the African American Policy Forum
via the #SayHerName campaign, and the ascent of social media stars
claiming ownership of the movement.
But all of this doesn’t explain why I’m not a joiner.
I think it comes down to romanticized childhood notions of movement
work. Throughout the years, I have developed a set of defense mechanisms
that make me a questionable-to-undermining member of non-work-related
groups.
One, I don’t take actions that risk my livelihood unless I fully agree with
the strategy and leadership. (In some dialects, that’s called “being a punk.”

## In others, it’s called “being smart.”)

Two, I have extremely high standards of individual accountability and
become embittered when people, particularly those in leadership, don’t meet
them.
Three, I don’t really trust anyone outside of my family and close friends.
I have no firsthand experience with COINTELPRO. I wasn’t even a zygote
as that murderous disgrace ripped through my people’s work. Even more
odd is that my biological and extended family have a deep organizing
history. My late grandma, Mamie Nichols, an incredible community servant
and organizer, has a freaking social service building named after her in her
beloved Point Breeze South Philadelphia neighborhood.
My mother cofounded a group called Sisters Remember Malcolm and
the Philadelphia Black Women’s Health Project. She was on the board of a
local Black organization called Art Sanctuary. She worked in the parent
organizing and school reform movement before right-wing operatives
hijacked them. Even in retirement, this woman fantasizes about getting
arrested doing her volunteer work with a multifaith grassroots network
called POWER.
Meanwhile, my father was in the Kwanzaa Cooperative, was a principal
member of an R&B band called The Company, and today works with the
Philadelphia Jazz Project, Philly Cam, and an unnamed group of retired
Black men trying to do something with coding and math. Like me, he
doesn’t consider himself to be a joiner.
My late uncle, Richard Nichols, was the longtime manager and architect
of The Roots, a group he helped hold together with revolutionary business
acumen and duct tape. My late aunt, Yvette “Kinyozi” Smalls, had her own
braid-based gang called Positive Hair Design. They didn’t bang on anything
but unhealthy Black hair, but they kept it hot at the annual Odunde Festival
and changed the minds of little Black girls who hated their kinky hair.
And what have I done?
Become someone who asks questions and then fact-checks, crosschecks, and triple-checks things people say for a living. Basically, my job
privileges skepticism and my well-documented paranoia.
That paranoia, which one of my best friends stops me from flippantly
calling “crazy,” is indeed justified by what I know of history. An informant
destroyed Denmark Vesey’s 1822 revolt in Charleston, South Carolina.
Ernest Withers, the Black photographer widely praised for taking some of
the most intimate images of the Civil Rights Movement, turned out to be a
paid FBI informant. William O’Neal, an FBI plant who became head of
security of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther Party, set up twentytwo-year-old chairman Fred Hampton to be murdered in his bed in a
Chicago police raid. Those police also murdered twenty-one-year-old Mark
Clark, and they sexually assaulted Hampton’s pregnant wife, then known as
Deborah Johnson, by opening her robe and exposing her naked body
auction-block style.
Besides scaring me, betrayals like these make me nauseous. A double
agent in a trusted space of struggle rips apart our culture of survival.
Betrayal makes us hypervigilant in unhealthy ways.
So while my inability to be a joiner is a source of frustration for me, I
know to keep my mess to myself. Visceral paranoia and defensive what-ifs
are not the best foundation for the kind of inspiration and faith that I believe
people fighting White supremacy together need. If someone nice with their
words (like me) always reserves the right to speak or change their mind, that
does not make them a brilliant strategist. It makes them a critic—or a
potentially toxic distraction. And yet, I know I am part of a greater project
and legacy. I stay in my lane, yes. But I will never, ever, in my little smidgen
of the world, let my folks be ground into dust. My position is not ideal, but
it is. I believe that is enough.

## Kenrya

It’s 1:00 a.m., and the mirrors are sweating.
Five of us are half-asleep in a surprisingly well-appointed room at the
Embassy Suites in Romulus, Michigan, and it is hot and humid as hell, as a
sixth woman makes clear after she quietly walks through and shuts the
heavy door to the room, dropping her carry-on bag to the floor.
“How are y’all sleeping in here?” she asks as I stumble out of bed to
help find the thermostat so we can turn off the heat.
We are so ragged from traveling that we haven’t even noticed it’s
sweltering. It’s been years since we crowded so many bodies into a room,
though at least on this post-college voyage everyone actually has a bed to
share. But we didn’t hesitate to form like Voltron for this trip, purchasing
last-minute airfares, renting a gleaming white Suburban, and piling into a
hotel room just beyond the edge of Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County
Airport. We are in town to help our linesister bury her father.
I am not one of those girls who grew up knowing she wanted to pledge.
Hell, I didn’t even grow up knowing that I wanted to attend an HBCU. I
applied to several colleges for undergrad, but when I hit the yard for a visit
one warm April day, I knew Howard University was the place for me. It was
my first time on an airplane, and I had never set foot in Washington, DC,
before that day, but being on that campus felt like being in my Black-ass
home.
We were everywhere! And we came in forms and fashions I had never
encountered, with paper-bag test winners laughing beside moonlight that
dared you to bring that colorism shit over here. The Jack and Jill set whose
families owned homes on Martha’s Vineyard sat on the steps of Douglass
beside those of us who had never heard of the enclave until Larenz Tate
graced its beaches in The Inkwell. Brooklyn dudes in Timbs who thought a
lazy two-step was the height of movement glared at the Atlanta cats who
pulled all the chicks with their carefree twerking.
And among the crowd, joined at the hips, were the ladies of Delta Sigma
Theta Incorporated’s Alpha Chapter. They threw the best social action
programs, ran the key campus organizations, raised the most money for
charity, and laughed the loudest in the caf. And I wanted in.
The average prospective member will tell you that she is seeking
membership because of the organization’s long history of social justice
advocacy and commitment to uplifting the Black community. And that
makes sense: after the twenty-two founders broke ties with the first Black
sorority to do their own thing, their initial official act was to participate in
the Women’s Suffrage Parade in March 1913. My “power to the people”
brain was drawn to the “say no more, fam” of it all—they didn’t think their
original organization was doing enough for Black folks, so they threw up
two fingers and did it themselves.
But the thing that captured my heart was seeing how the women on the
line before mine interacted on campus. They were, in a word, sisterly. I
could do community service beside anyone, but I was drawn to these
women who came to the District from all over and found each other. They
worked together, played together, fucked shit up together. And I too wanted
a group of like-minded baddies to run the world with. So I pledged.
To this day, when anyone asks me about my Delta journey, I skip over
the stuff I’m sure they want to know (Delta business is Delta business), and
I tell them the most important part: my linesisters are the very best thing
about this lifetime commitment.
I’ve worked with many groups over the years, organizing voter drives
with my NAACP youth chapter, serving as chief of staff for HU’s student
administration, teaching Saturday school for Black and Brown kids in New
York City’s Alphabet City, helping Black co-eds develop their leadership
skills. But for me, no group has illustrated quite as clearly the importance of
working toward a goal—be it to stop responding when that fuckboy texts or
to loosen the grip that Whiteness run amok has on our lives—with arms
linked. My linesisters, you see, have shaped me.
We bonded on campus, but it was in the years after we graduated—as we
found and lost and found ourselves many times over—that we became each
other’s limbs. These ladies have been with me when I was at my lowest
(propping me up as I processed the trauma of my marriage and subsequent
divorce) and highest (watching my cooch intently as I pushed my kid out on
all fours).
And then there are the funerals. We’ve gotten to an age where we are
nursing our children while we bury those who first taught us to love. One
day they are here, cooking oxtails for their grandchildren, musing on their
days playing professional baseball, buying us crystal-encrusted elephants.
And then their bodies are gone. But their souls abide.
And so does our sisterhood.

## THE STRUGGLE IS REAL

Can we take a minute to acknowledge that it has been a fucked-up few years? Like we’re perpetually having a sock slid down in your boot, bonnet
came off last night so your twistout is fuzzy, “Why do people refuse to learn
the lessons of our abundant history of racial oppression?” kind of
Groundhog Day. You can’t even get lost online to escape it anymore; these
days, social media is mostly a doomsday delivery service for the kind of
breaking news that reminds us daily just how shitty things are.
      For many, the current state of the world feels like abstract unease. It
causes low-level dread, but it doesn’t impact your ability to sleep, work, or
otherwise adult. For others, it feels like craning your neck to scan the sky
for a glimpse of the next bomb before it flattens you: your back hurts like
hell and you’re not at all confident that you can get out of the way quickly
enough.
      But for some, it’s like someone dropped a wall made of solid shit
directly in their path. It cuts off all routes to a quiet, peaceful life (and
smells like, well, shit). For those people, there is no navigating around the
obstacles manufactured by rotting systems. Whether they lost a child to
state-sanctioned violence or were taught from an early age that their
humanity wasn’t guaranteed, they have been thrust into fights they did not
necessarily choose. So when the wall blocks their way, the only thing to do
is lace up their Timbs, pull back their hair, and get to clawing. For them, my
friend, the struggle is real. Real dirty, real heartbreaking, real personal.
Whether battling the accumulated trauma of microaggressions or
fighting police violence, the people in this chapter turned personal
tribulations into work that seeks to dismantle the elements of White
supremacy.
Constance Malcolm: “I Joined a Club That I Never Knew I’d Be a

## Part Of”

On February 2, 2012, three weeks before George Zimmerman killed
Trayvon Martin, a White police officer named Richard Haste fatally shot
Black eighteen-year-old Ramarley Graham in his Bronx apartment.
Graham’s maternal grandmother, Patricia Hartley, was close enough that
some of his blood landed on her chest. His brother, then six, was only a few
feet away. His mother, Constance Malcolm, arrived home a half-hour later
to yellow tape.
The initial police version had Graham exiting a bodega under the
surveillance of an undercover drug unit, “walking with a purpose” and
fidgeting with his waistband, an alleged sign of gun possession. Haste,
according to a police spokesman, followed Graham into the house,
struggled with him in front of the family’s bathroom, and then came the
shot.
But cameras.
Cameras on his building’s exterior showed Graham walking to his front
door, quickly glancing over his shoulder, and entering. Moments later,
there’s Haste running up to the door, trying to yank it open, and kicking it
repeatedly.
Haste eventually went to the back of the building, where a neighbor let
him in. What the cameras couldn’t show is how the officer unlocked the
apartment door for two other cops, kicked in the door to Graham’s unit, and
shot him.
Unlike in so many other cases, Haste actually went before a grand jury.
During the hearing, attorneys for the police called Graham “the perp” and
declared him an “imminent threat.” The grand jury indicted Haste for
manslaughter, but a Bronx County Supreme Court judge overturned the
decision on the grounds that the jury had received improper instructions. A
second grand jury failed to indict Haste.
The family eventually settled a civil case against the city for $3.9
million. But Haste and the officers in his unit were still on the job. In March
2017, facing dismissal, Haste was allowed to quit with dignity. Another
officer involved, Sergeant Scott Morris, reportedly resigned after settling
departmental charges in December 2017.
Malcolm, a certified nursing assistant, has become a leading voice in
police reform. She was one of the leaders of a 2015 campaign that
compelled New York governor Andrew Cuomo to issue an executive order
authorizing the state attorney general’s office to act as a special prosecutor
for police killings.
At the time of this interview, Malcolm was awaiting the NYPD’s
response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. If the force is
cooperative, it will reveal what all of the other officers involved in the
killing and its aftermath did that day. While she waited for the outcome of
the suit, Constance talked to Akiba about how she wakes up every day.
One of the things that really stands out to me is that over all of
these years, what police tried to tell you about what happened
doesn’t make any sense. Frankly, it seems you would get burnt
out and quit. How do you continue to do this work?
When this happened to me, I didn’t know anything about activism. But I
knew that I had to tell the story of my son—not what they [portrayed] him
to be, like he had a gun and was selling drugs. That wasn’t so. He was
meeting a couple of friends to see some young ladies. This was at the height
of stop-and-frisk, and Black men were disproportionately stopped. It was
like, “We have to bring our numbers up. That’s how we make our money, by
incarcerating these young men.”
So my son fell in that category. But they never found a gun. They started
to backtrack and say that they saw a drug transaction. There was none. So I
started organizing rallies every Thursday. I did eighteen on that day of the
week because Ramarley died on a Thursday and he was eighteen years old.
Then I was like, “Okay, this is bigger than just the precinct where the police
officers came from.” We had to start from the top. First we pushed for the
DA to charge this officer, Richard Haste. They charged him with
manslaughter one and two. On the day he was arraigned, I saw this man was
just laughing, as if my child didn’t matter.
I’m sorry—Haste was in court laughing?
When he got bail, he came out of the court laughing. And one of his
fellow officers was cheering him on, saying, “You the man!” And I’m like,
Wait a minute. What is “you the man” about? You killed a young man that
posed no threat to you.
Who did you rally with?
I had a group of people from the community. I had one young lady I
didn’t know, [Black Lives Matter cofounder] Patrisse Kahn-Cullors. She
said, “This could be my brother.” She was at the court organizing. Then
other organizations started coming in, like Justice Committee, Police United
for Reform, Moms Rising, and Make the Road. These were young people.
When I saw them, I saw my son. And this is why I fight so hard. There was
this one young man, Darien, who would always come to anything I did and
bring a whole bunch of other young kids with him. He just reminded me so
much of Ramarley. Up until this day, I cry when I talk about it.
How are your mom and your other son doing?
My mom is angry, but she doesn’t talk about it. I worry about my son.
He was six when it happened, and now he’s twelve going on thirteen. He
watched this whole thing unfold, and I don’t know where his headspace is
right now. What if a cop decides to stop him and he decides, like, I don’t
want to talk to you because I don’t trust you. I remember what you did to my
brother. These are the things that go through my head. I remember when we
were living on the block where the precinct is. He was like, “I want to blow
up the precinct.” I was like, “Not all cops are bad.” But how can I tell a
child that when he watched what happened to his brother?
Has your activism ever felt like a burden to you?
There are times where it gets very heavy, when I want to be home. But
I’ve got to be in the street. When things like this happen, you’re in a hole.
There’s no handbook on how a mother should react after losing a child, how
to go pick a casket out and how to go pick a hole to bury your son in. When
I go to talk to a person that lost a loved one, I let them know to bury their
child first, before everything else, because your mind is clouded right now.
Get that over with. Once your loved one is well situated in their resting
place, then you can deal with the fight.
I read that you’re active in the union at your job. Is that right?
Yeah, I’m a nurse’s assistant and an 1199 member—1199SEIU United
Healthcare Workers East. They’ve been supportive from day one.
Wow. So you take care of people for a living too?
Yes, I take care of the elderly, people with Alzheimer’s, everything. In
and of itself, it’s a very stressful job. There have been times when I’d go to
work with people I didn’t know and they would say, “I saw you on TV,
what’s going on?” But my job is my job. It’s very complicated to explain
that to people sometimes.
I interviewed Tamir Rice’s mom once, and she shared how
people would walk up to her out of nowhere and try to hug her.
She would get blindsided. Have you had that experience?
I get it a lot, but I know they don’t mean any harm. The only thing that
gets me really pissed off is when people come up to me like, “Oh, but you
got a lot of settlement money.” I’m like, “You think I’m in this for money?
They could have the money and give me my son back.”
So before Ramarley was killed, did you think much about race
and racism?
No. Honestly, I didn’t. I came to this country from Jamaica when I was
thirteen years old. Back then, I used to see cops playing with the kids in the
neighborhood. We used to have block parties and they’d come.
But as the years went by, you see cops beating up people. Kids come
from school and they’d throw them against the wall and harass them. They
just started beating on the kids as if they don’t have a right to ask, “Why you
stopping me?” I would see kids, when the cops came, automatically face the
wall and put their hands up. You don’t see this happen in neighborhoods
like Scarsdale, where you see ten little White boys together and it’s okay.
But in this neighborhood, you see ten Black boys walking, it’s a gang. The
game is so unbalanced, it’s not real.
What do you think would have to happen for things to be equal?
We’ll never have change until cops actually get the time that they deserve
for the crimes they commit. We’ve got to keep organizing, keep doing all
this stuff that we shouldn’t have to do to get basic answers for our loved
ones.
For you, does talking to media and having press conferences
help?
It helps me because I’m telling the story about what happened to my
son. And another mother will look at me and say, “You know what? She’s
been fighting. I can do the same thing if it happens to me.” But the reason
why I’m in the fight is because I wanted to fight. You’ve got to want to fight.
A lot of times, when I’m in bed, I think, I can’t do this anymore. But I owe
it to my kids.
Do you ever get to go on vacation?
Actually, I’m going on vacation for a couple of days, away from here. I
never even wanted to because when I was fighting, I felt like if I left, the
story would just die. We had to let the Department of Justice know, “Listen,
we ain’t going nowhere. You might as well just meet with us and let us
know what’s going on.” I’m always going to kick a door down. You’re
gonna give me answers. I see myself as a winner. Because at the end of the
day, I got two cops off the force.
What would you tell another parent who, God forbid, has their
child killed by police?
You know, I joined a club that I never knew I’d be a part of. It’s a club I
would not invite anybody to be in. I know mothers who have been out here
for twenty years fighting and nothing has changed. But I tell people, “We
didn’t get voters’ rights overnight. We’ve got to continue to fight.” One door
closes, another one always opens. We just gotta keep fighting.
     I fight White supremacy by raising my daughter to take up space and
              make her voice heard in a world that wants to quiet her.

Conversations with Microaggressions and the Spirit World

## Asali Solomon

1. Eating out with a large group of graduate students in the English

Department of the University of California at Berkeley, an institution whose
reputation for progressive thought was running on fumes by the early 2000s.
“O” was younger than me, a twerp radiating the hostile energy that I
associated with White male devotees of Literary Modernism. Back then,
before they had to add Hurston, Larsen, and Hughes to the syllabus,
Modernism was the classic rock of English literature: White male–
dominated, purportedly edgy, the pinnacle of post-Shakespeare
achievement, a legitimate way to avoid the multiracial American literary
reality of the 1960s to the ’80s and Toni Morrison.
     When these dudes weren’t sitting around using Hegel to decode Stevens,
they were spitting the word “diversity” and commiserating
unselfconsciously about how hard it would be for them to get academic jobs
## *
because of being qualified White men.
     At the dinner we were talking about public transportation and agreed
that the bus was the worst. The bus in Oakland evoked passages from Julia
Kristeva’s Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection. The smell could most
charitably be described as deeply human. Some of the passengers looked
like their skin hurt. Bugs were involved. Once, a drunk and disheveled man
peed on the bus; I watched the stream roll slowly toward the front exit under
my feet. When the driver kicked him off, he tried to blame “the fella that
had just got off.” I told that story at the dinner. I’m no saint. I’m a clown.
But racism always has the last laugh.
     I mentioned that I rode the 51 bus. “The 51,” “O” chimed in
enthusiastically. “You’re lucky!” says “O”. “There are White people on that
bus!”
What I said is not even worth mentioning.
2(a). An elderly White person beelined down a hill toward me on the
campus in the South at a university named for Robert E. Lee where, sadly, I
was on the faculty:

## “Are you a law student?”

## “I’m a professor.”

## “It’s a compliment!”

What I said: “Thanks.”
2(b). When we first met, the proprietor of the best thrift shop in town (a man
who would later argue with me, claiming I was another Black woman)

## asked, “You a student at the college?”

## “A professor.”

## “It’s a compliment!”

What I said: “Okay.”
2(c). Another day. Another White person: “You a law student?”

## “Professor in the English Department.”

## “It’s a compliment!”

3. A high school friend was concerned she wouldn’t get into Brown, her

top-choice college. “I mean, I’m a White girl,” she wailed.

## What I said, with a sinking feeling: “Right.”

What I should have said: “Who do you think is at Brown?”

4. In the majority-White suburban private school I traveled to from the city

daily, “H” fancied herself street-smart. (She was the kind of middle-grade
girl in the 1980s who dropped the Viet- from -Nam.) There she was, asking
me and my best friend, also Black, to poke out our lips.
What I did: poke out my lips and wonder why she was doubled over
laughing.

5. One night as a graduate student in Iowa City, a place where insults were

regularly leveled against my ancestors in the form of fiction workshop
discussions and literary bar banter, I walked into a party at an unknown
house. A tall thin White man emerged from the shadows like Dracula.
“Hello, Black Angel,” he said.
What I regret (fifteen years later) not saying: “Hello, White Devil.”

6. A female voice screeched “nigger!” out of a car as it drove past me. I was

standing on the corner after high school, waiting for a bus to go to therapy.
What I did: Go to therapy. For ten years.
Microaggressions are like wack lovers and even more wack than the word
“lover.” The memories linger like slobbery kisses and jabby little dicks and
the shame that somehow wound up on you. When you repeat them to other
people, the stories are dull and incomprehensible, like dreams. We want to
respond exactly the right way, but we never do. Sometimes we don’t even
know what’s happening until it’s too late, but also, if we could have shut it
down in the moment, none of it would have happened in the first place.
We’d be in an entirely different world.
The master text of the microaggression is Claudia Rankine’s monster of
a book, 2014’s Citizen: An American Lyric. It captures the unreality of the
microaggression moment. When confronted with hot White
inappropriateness, the speaker repeatedly queries, “Was this racist, or was I
just being oversensitive?” Instead of (verbally?) backhanding someone, we
get caught up in the moment, reconstructing the crime: he was standing over
here, the dog was there, it was raining, she was born in 1956.… As of the
writing of this essay there is no known cure for microaggressions; the only
salve is time. But more time equals more microaggressions.
Maybe these incidents aren’t the end of the world. They often occur in
rarefied spaces: ivory towers and frivolous stores, outside the yoga studio in
the gentrifying neighborhood, for fuck’s sake, where some lady is bracing
herself to ward off your panhandling even though you’re clearly wearing
yoga clothes and carrying a mat like everybody else. But microaggressions
signal that the end is coming; after all, they happen for the same exact
reason that seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones, sleeping in her home, was
shot to death by an agent of the state. It’s your hair, your skin, your
ancestors. And peace and power to the late Chester Pierce, the brilliant
Black psychiatrist who coined the term “microaggressions” in the 1970s,
but now that everybody who doesn’t watch Fox News knows what they are,
it might be time to clarify that there’s nothing micro about aggression.
Fuck that prefix.
When somebody follows you around a store, or makes a watermelon
joke onstage before they hand you a National Book Award, they are offering
you a look behind the gauzy veneer of “civilized” Whiteness into the
massive, rotten, pulsing, monstrous reality that’s always there.
Philando Castile, killed during a 2016 traffic stop in Minnesota, had
been pulled over by police at least forty-nine times in the preceding thirteen
years. Consider, if you will, the “micro” encounters he lived through.
Consider instead that he was murdered. How many ways are there to say
this? It might be happening in Rikers and it might be happening at Harvard,
but a “microaggression” happens because White people and their allies
want to kill you.
Writing in 2018, from the terrifying dystopian novel that is our reality,
I’m prepared to forecast a 100 percent chance of a rising tide of
microaggressions. And yet I’m still here reviewing trifling bullshit that
somebody said to me thirty years ago, still looking for the snappy comeback
that would have shut it down, knowing deep down that there was really
nothing to say that could have repaired the psychic damage.
But there are conversations I would rather be having in my mind and in
real life. I want to ask a Lenape woman in the area now known as the
Delaware Valley about life before White people arrived. I want to ask Toni
Morrison impertinent questions about her love life: who covers her with a
throw blanket when she naps on the couch (and ask if she has ever in her
life napped on the couch). I want to talk to the man with no gloves, in heavy
work clothes in the freezing Thirty-Seventh Street trolley station, about his
inspired decision to warm us up with creamy ’70s Philadelphia music
blasting from his cell phone.
I want to ask Madam C. J. Walker if she’s cool with the pervasive Black
hair care practice of wearing some other person’s hair entirely.
I want to practice my Spanish with artist and fierce activist Elizabeth
Catlett, who hauled off and went to live, not in Europe like many of her
midcentury contemporaries, but in Mexico, where she promptly ditched her
husband, met and married a Mexican artist, had three of what must have
been the era’s most interesting children, and got herself banned from
Amerikkka.
I want to talk to some literary-minded escaped slaves who couldn’t get
their memoirs published, partly to see if they’ll talk trash about Frederick,
Harriet, and Henry “Box” Brown. I have questions for Assata, for my
paternal grandmother, Carolyn Solomon, who died before I was born. My
mother says she came to visit me one night, a spirit looking into my crib.
Did she?
I have a surprising number of questions for Drake. Does he ever call any
of the Degrassi kids, Spinner or Ashley, “late night” after he’s done calling
## *
Outback Steakhouse hostesses and Hot Topic employees?
I want to talk to my uncle Richard, who complained about everything
while he was here on earth. I want to ask him what it’s like over there where
he’s been since the summer of 2014. I want to ask him if there’s a heaven
for a G.

## On the Trauma of Being Black in White Spaces

## Quinn Gee

“We think you need to see a therapist, just to process,” “J” said, looking
at me over her glasses.
It was 2015, and I was sitting in the office of my clinical supervisor and
her practice partner. I had just told them what it felt like to be the only
person of color in a room of more than 100 White people for eight hours. I
was completing my practicum for my master’s degree in counseling, and we
were in Memphis, Tennessee, for a reconstruction, which is an experiential
therapy created by Virginia Satir that involves the telling and retelling of a
life story primarily in a group setting that impacts all the people present.
A wave of anxiety had hit me the moment I walked into the great hall
(admittedly late, ’cause, Black). I immediately scanned the room, searching
for someone who had some tint to them, and I was quickly disappointed. I
sat in the group circle, doing the required check-in with everyone else in the
room and trying to ground myself. But I had to get out. I pretended to go to
the bathroom, but instead escaped to my Chrysler Pacifica and cried for ten
minutes. Over the course of the day, I was forced outside four times, never
feeling like I could center myself emotionally or even identify exactly what
the issue was. Despite being in a room full of my peers, I felt isolated, like
no one there understood the physiological and emotional effect that being
the only Black woman in that space was having on me.
So it didn’t help when this White man and White woman told me that I
should seek counseling to figure out why I was so emotional. I felt like they
pathologized my concerns rather than addressing them.
“Go see ‘M’ and work out what’s going on with you,” my supervisor
said. I walked out of that office and right back to the refuge of my truck. I
kept thinking, There must be something wrong with me if they want me to
talk to another therapist about this. I trusted them with my burgeoning
career and looked up to them profoundly. They both had minority identities
(one was Jewish and one was gay), so I assumed they understood how it felt
to be othered. But that interaction made it clear that I was on my own, a
Black queer woman in a White space that was unfriendly to my existence.
At the time of this incident, I didn’t know that repeated exposure to
microaggressions could cause post-traumatic stress disorder–like
symptoms. Not only did I not have language to explain what was happening
to me, but I couldn’t even identify exactly what was happening to me. I did
know that it was wrong, and that if I—a woman who prided herself on
being comfortable and unapologetically Black in predominantly White
spaces—could be made to feel that uncomfortable, then surely there were
others who felt this way. I also knew that I couldn’t go on in that
environment. I resigned a month later and the next day founded my first
clinic, Healing Hearts Counseling Center in Memphis.
Then I began seeking out information about how race impacts mental
health. I discovered the works of Robert Carter, PhD, who coined the term
“race-based traumatic stress injury” (RBTSI), which he defines as “an
emotional/psychological response to racial experiences that results in
## *
functional impairment (makes activities of daily living difficult).” Simply
put, RBTSI is what happens to people of color after repeated exposure to
microaggressions and racism. Working, living, and going to school in areas
that are predominantly White can have some of the same long-term
psychological effects as actual physical trauma. Think about what a
testament that is to White supremacy: merely existing in spaces with White
folks can be permanently damaging to your mental health.
You can see the effects of intergenerational RBTSI everywhere,
especially now that there are criteria to measure it. The high rate of PTSD
diagnosis in Black people is the most prominent indicator. And some of the
somatic symptoms that come with it are more prevalent in Black folks,
including hypertension, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses. Yes,
fatback may have strained your heart, but being subjected to White folks’
prejudice daily is just as heartbreaking.
And RBTSI doesn’t only kick in following overt racism. It can occur
anytime your Blackness is not primary in the environment, which we know
is linked to microaggressions that over time can have a long-standing impact
on your self-esteem and motivation and often result in depression and anger.
Just think about how you feel in these situations:
       Your coworkers drop by your desk to ask about your hair every time
       you change it.
       Someone asks any question that starts with, “Why do Black people…”
       A White woman clings a little tighter to her purse when you walk past.
       This bro at the bar keeps inappropriately using outdated AAVE.
     Randoms fetishize you sexually (“I only date Black”) and culturally
     (also known as “Dolezaling”).
     People who don’t know you grant themselves unwanted access to your
     person (touching your hair, standing very close to you, performing
     exaggerated handshakes based on stereotypes).
Like PTSD, some of the symptoms of RBTSI include anxiety,
avoidance, and arousal, and the symptoms can present suddenly, without
warning. Unlike PTSD, however, RBTSI does not involve direct physical
## *
threats to your person but is based on emotional pain.
RBTSI is not recognized officially by the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), the diagnostic tool used by all the
major mental health organizations, but it has been widely used and
referenced since its introduction in 1952. And let’s face it, as with
everything, there is racial bias within the mental health community. A
White former colleague once fixed his mouth to tell me that “race trauma is
just a smokescreen for psychosis.” So of course it is highly unlikely that a
diagnosis that only affects people of color and that is caused by White
people will make it into any drafts of the DSM-VI.
But for mental health clinicians in the know, it is important to provide
culturally competent support for our clients. White people aren’t going
away; we have to find a way to exist with them. So how do we combat the
issues that arise from RBTSI? More specifically, how do we deal with
White people when they are a source of trauma?
We lean into each other as sources of community and support. When we
feel safe and equipped, we let White people know our boundaries. We hold
proclaimed allies accountable around their actions. We refuse to discount
each other’s experiences. We reject the cry of “not all White people” as a
tactic to diminish our experiences. We don’t let them touch our damn hair.
And finally, we go to Black therapists.

## “BLK PWR TWTR” by John Jennings (2015)

How do you describe your aesthetic?
      My aesthetic could be called critical race design. I make visual artifacts
that interrogate constructions of race.
What were you thinking when you created this work?
      I created this piece after the Mother Emanuel shooting in South
Carolina, where nine African American church members were senselessly
killed by a White supremacist. I do some social media on Twitter, but it’s
not my usual space for commentary. However, I know that Black Twitter has
become a powerful space of resistance, discussion, critique, and healing in
the age of Black Lives Matter. I created this piece as a symbol of solidarity
for everyone who uses Twitter as a space to fight against the murder and
oppression of Black Americans. I was truly honored that it was selected for
the permanent digital collection of the National Museum of African

How does this work represent resistance to White supremacy?
The piece samples and remixes the Twitter logo with a Black Power fist.
By conflating this cultural symbol of unity with a corporate logo used for
communication, this image repurposes both. It represents resistance by its
very construction and societal significance. It is an index of how Black
Twitter has created a space of political power in spite of White supremacy
and corporate control.

## Maladaptations and Deportations

## Marlon Peterson

During my ten-year journey on the slave ship of incarceration, I never
had a dream that carried me outside prison. When I dreamed about family,
friends, or rendezvous with old girlfriends (which provided me with muchneeded wet dreams), they were always in prison with me. I brought free-ish
people into my experience of prison; even in the depths of my subconscious,
I could not fathom being unbound.
About a year into my bid, I consciously decided that I needed to put all
of my focus into learning how to exist as a slave. It became my occupation. I
broke myself in. I manufactured and perfected the normalization of my own
despair. It was necessary to survive.
It seemed all the men around me had submitted to a lucid normalization
of our lives in prison. We euphemistically thought of cuffs and shackles as
bracelets. We referred to the visiting floor as the dance floor. We called
letters kites, perhaps to signify that our communication with the outside
world and with our comrades in other housing units and other jails could fly
above the ground of despair to which we were bound. We asked our families
to send us Timberland boots and gave each other fly haircuts. We created
communities of Bloods and Crips and N~etas and Lions and Latin Kings.
We did dumb shit.
      We’ve been doing this type of dumb shit for centuries. Our despair
predated our dumb shit, our euphemisms, our dancing. The cruelty of White
supremacy is the despair. The depth of that cruelty is why to this very day I
often talk about my prison experience in the present tense, despite the fact
that it’s been almost nine years since I left that ship.
      Prison was hard. It was painful. It was horrific. There were days I wished
I could die unexpectedly. It’s where officers threw my family pictures in
toilet bowls, stepped on the bed sheet I slept on, farted into my cell,
searched the inside of my mouth after I gave my mother a kiss on her cheek
at the end of a one-hour visit, kept me in a cell for twenty-three hours a day
for forty-five days, and starved me when I didn’t get dressed quickly enough.
Prison is also where I mastered the art of hiding pain, horror, and fear.
      Prison was where I lived Angela Davis’s words: “Jails and prisons are
designed to turn its residents into animals in a zoo—obedient to our
keepers, but dangerous to each other.” It was where I identified the genesis
of my keepers’ behavior—their job is the progeny of White supremacist
ideology.
      The lineage of White supremacy in the world’s prisons is clear. There is
a process to enslaving Africans: Present enslavement as a better way to
capitalize on human greed; capitalize on internecine conflicts; rationalize
the inhumanity of prolonged imprisonment as a solution to human
delinquency; capture; rename; send the captured far away; limit access to
loved ones; invest in the idea of penitence; convince the captured that there
is nothing to consider but individual accountability; starve; abuse; instill
fear; encourage more internecine strife; never harm the captor; dress its
perpetrators as benevolent saviors; manufacture a form of freedom that is
reliant upon acting as if the harm never occurred (successful reentry is all
that matters); create a new nigger.
      Halfway through my bid, a prison counselor said to me, “You are not
Mr. Peterson. You are Inmate Peterson.” He tried to create a whole new
nigger out of me.
      And he did.
But I fought. I won small victories. I helped other men write their parole
interview packets and win their freedom. I published stories of my
colleagues inside who were innocent. I masturbated to pictures of old
girlfriends and images of beautiful women I saw on television instead of
engaging in the porn magazine trade. I never acted on my desire to do
harmful shit to others. I responded to officers with respect no matter how
much they disrespected me. I earned a college degree. I read Malcolm, bell,
Maya, and Sister Souljah. I came home one month early.
I maladapted to docility.
But White supremacy still stung me. It deported me to a world that says
that prison saved me. To a world where a smooth reentry is more important
than a rejuvenation of spirit and dignity. To a world where the liberal vision
for reducing incarceration is motivated by fiduciary concerns rather than
moral ones. To a world where capitalism rewards Whites living in majorityBlack spaces. To a world where people of color are the ones languishing on
the street corners and overcrowding the prisons. To a world where allegiant
subscribers to White supremacy get to exploit mental illness as an excuse
for the dangerous behavior their ideology encourages. To a world where our
radical Black imagination is funded by White institutions that we are
convinced we can infiltrate for good.
Our modern-day heroes—Michelle, Oprah, Ava, Beyoncé—have
mastered thriving alongside White supremacy. They create and invest in art
that inspires us despite its clutches. I too have figured out what I can
accomplish despite the presence of White supremacy. I earned a second
degree from a top private university. Secured a decent credit score. Traveled
the world. Shared my story with thousands of young people. Gave a TED
Talk with more than one million views, asking people to experience me as a
full human being. (White supremacy got me begging for humanity—how
preposterous is that?) Lectured at several universities. Successfully
completed state parole. Started my own podcast. Told my story on television
and in Ebony magazine.
I beat the odds.
But the problem with my narrative is that there are odds to beat. This
system has convinced us that overcoming strife is a necessary part of life. It
has manipulated us into not recognizing that White supremacy is the odds.
Neither the splendor of our heroes nor our personal tales of triumph go
far enough. A Newish America is still America—a place that has evolved
from slavery to the creation of Black urban ghettos, to drug infestation, to
mass incarceration, to deportation. So, while we have won measurable
victories against America—citizenship, voting rights, and so on—we still
have a long way to go on the road toward dismantling the system that forces
us to fight.

## QUESTION, ANSWERED

     The people in this chapter were driven to activism following personal
experiences with racism and the people who perpetuate it. Here we answer
the question: what drives you?

## Kenrya

     The politically correct answer would be “love.” And sure, okay, that’s
true. I am passionately in love with my people, my kid, probably some dude
I haven’t met yet, and the idea that we can make that change (read: make
racists cry) like Michael Jackson eliciting White girl tears at Super Bowl
XXVII. But the real, I’m lightheaded because I keep holding my breath,
why can I hear my heart pounding in my ears right now, ohmygod I need to
go lie down on the soft gray rug in my living room and stare up at the
twinkling lights on my Christmas tree until I get my shit together answer is,

## “Anxiety mostly.”

     Which is patently awful, but not unique. There is not a human breathing
who has not experienced anxiety. It fuels the fight-or-flight response that
keeps us alive when raccoons brandish their tiny, too-human, trash-digging
hands at us. It makes us stumble over our words when a @TheRealTank
lookalike gets close enough to breathe him in. Alerts us when we have to go
off on a “well-meaning” White woman who just showered us with bullshit.
And who among us has not been propelled across a finish line by the fear
that we would pass out along the way? For every writer who says they can’t
function without a deadline, I’ll show you an anxiety-ridden soul who lives
in constant fear of waiting a little too long to step away from the
procrastination and get shit done right now.
Recently, my daughter performed in her first violin recital. She played
Shinichi Suzuki’s “Mississippi Hot Dog” variation of “Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star,” and her little brown face shone with delight and the effort of
concentration. But before she took the stage in the spare wood-paneled
church sanctuary where her teacher had gathered us for the occasion, her
face was scrunched with worry.
“Maaaama,” she said, left arm slung around my neck. “I don’t want to
play. I have butterflies in my tummy, and I don’t want people to look at me.”
“Baeba,” I said, planting a kiss on her soft cheek, then wiping it clean
with my thumb. “I know you feel nervous. I feel nervous when I have to be
in front of people too. Every time. But,” I continued, smiling, “do you know
what feeling anxious makes us do?”
She tilted her head—she’d heard this before.
“It makes us prepare,” I said. “And you prepared! You practice your
violin every day, right?”

## “Yes, Mama.”

“And you know how to play this song, right?

## “Yup!”

“Then your tickly butterflies prepared you to do well tonight. And I’m so
excited to see you on that stage. You are amazing, and you’re gonna do a
great job.”
She grinned, spun away, then sat down on the pew between her homegirl
and her cousin, ready to pick up her one-eighth-size violin, propelled by a
weird feeling in her tummy and a tiny pep talk. What a blessing to have
anxieties that a mama can soothe with an iridescent purple kiss and a
reminder of who she is.
That’s not my reality.
I move through the world as a “we.” We need to tear down this system of
mass incarceration that means us nothing but harm. We need political
representation that actually cares about Black women every day, not just
when our voting power can help them keep a sex offender out of office. We,
the Black delegation, no longer fuck with that clueless actress who thinks
people give a damn about her thoughts on politics.
While my personal issues keep me in therapy, it’s my larger-scale “we”
concerns that push me forward. They compel me to grab my phone at 6:30
a.m. to scroll through the news, looking for the events, voices, and
campaigns I need to amplify for people of color that day. They push me to
help organize anti-bias training for the staff and parents at my daughter’s
school. They require me to seek out Black folks to take my coin for
everything from head wraps to dentistry.
     I am propelled by an aching need to protect and elevate my people. To be
sure, it’s a “we” anxiety. But when I look at my little’s face, I am reminded
that none of us is free unless we are all free. Ultimately, I’m working so that
my kid’s worries can continue to be one-eighth-size.

## Akiba

     In general, what drives me is human being 101: food, clothing, shelter,
and health care. But once I push beyond the prerequisites, my biggest driver
is boredom. I greatly fear being bored, and boring the people I find
interesting. That fear drives my work, many of my relationships, and the
way I move in the world.
     The first time I bored someone it nearly killed me—at least emotionally.
     I was a cute little Leo kid used to getting positive attention from adults
and peers. My slightly older Aquarian sister was the center of everything for
me; she was the smartest, the most inventive, the most fun.
     My mother called us “professional players” because of the worlds we
created. Our main site was Babyland, where our always-Black, factory
overrun dolls had copresidents. This nation also featured a special dialect
and a death that did not kill the physical body but destroyed your “Babyland
Thought.” When our play cousins and friends tried to do our Babyland
slang, my sister and I would exchange smug glances and abort the game.
     But at about seven, my sister decided that books were far superior to the
cracking plastic dolls we’d obtained from a Santa who came to our North
Philly preschool with a trash bag full of dreams. Also boring, according to
Asali: spacemen, Memory, I Declare War, Uno, Simon, checkers, Hungry
Hungry Hippos, Operation, Life, and Barbies. The passable games were
chess, Monopoly, and backgammon, all of which required too much
forethought and cunning for me to ever win.
I say that Asali’s boredom nearly killed me because she was the only real
friend I had. Growing up Black nationalist with an African name and
natural hair, celebrating Kwanzaa, not playing outside with the conceited
twins up the street, speaking “proper,” having restricted television viewing,
and never getting beatings made us bizarros in our working-class West
Philadelphia neighborhood. I don’t remember this bothering me until my
sister and I entered an overwhelmingly White and rich all-girls school in the
suburbs. We were there for the academics, to obtain the tools we would
need to rebuild a postrevolutionary world, not to make friends. One
consequence was that when Asali announced that she was bored with a
game I’d pitifully wheedled her into playing, what I heard was, You are all
alone because you are boring.
At open mics and karaoke birthday parties, I always sing Stevie Wonder’s
“Knocks Me off My Feet.” The hook of that song goes, “I don’t want to
bore you with it, oh but I love you, I love you, I love you.” I always get extra
on the hook.
When you lose your first soulmate—mine being my sister—avoiding
rejection begins to drive what you do and fantasize about. In the dream
arena I was constantly planning the Black king I would marry, the watoto
we would make, and the Black liberation we would help secure through our
art and work.
I do get this honestly. At press time, my parents have been married for
forty-six years and have had the same home and phone number for more
than forty years. My sister is in her own marriage with my two fascinating
nephews. My best friend is married to a man whom she met because he
interned for my mother. She’s the mom of a genuinely enjoyable toddler.
Family is everything for me.
There’s a line in one of my favorite films, Paid in Full, in which the
girlfriend of a successful Harlem drug dealer, Ace, tells him that she just
wants a nice, boring life with him and their baby. That line sticks with me,
always.
Alas, I am unpartnered. I am without a child. I don’t live in Philly, where all
of the aforementioned people have homes. I’m in Brooklyn, New York,
where being a grown woman means not heating up your Prego via juststrained hot pasta. Before I realized that this Black love writ large was not
going to happen, I thought a husband and a kid would prompt me to run
every morning, make vacation plans, do my affirmations, buy a home, be
unselfish, get dental checkups every six months, go up to the school to talk
to the principal, and always take my kid’s call like my mom did.
     In the absence of most of those healthy and domestic tasks, I have the
work I do. I am driven to make, facilitate, and house things that have a good
chance of enhancing the lives of people who look like me. Up until very
recently, I thought of this as false martyrdom or a rationalization for why I
failed at the life I imagined. Now I see it as the mission I did not
consciously create but that is the result of what I continually say to the
world.
     My work quells my fears. And if I do bore you, I’ve secured a tomorrow
where I can try again.

## THREE

## LAUGH TO KEEP FROM CRYING

Humor is among our toughest suits of armor against White supremacy. One-liners, irony, tall tales, impressions, satire, signifying, playing the
dozens, and trolling are all tools that we’ve used to reinforce our culture,
pass down mother wit, and vent our rage without getting lynched, fired, or
otherwise destroyed.
     Take one Brother Jourdon Anderson. In 1864, near the end of the Civil
War, Jourdon, his wife Mandy, and his family escaped during a Union raid
on the Big Spring, Tennessee, plantation of Colonel Patrick Henry
Anderson. After they were good and free in Ohio, Massa Anderson sent
them a bizarre letter begging them to return to the plantation to work, this
time for pay.
     We’re pretty sure that Brother Jourdon did indeed want to go back to Big
Spring—to slash ol’ massa’s face into ribbons. But instead of ending up in a
noose, he got his revenge via sarcasm about reparations. He told massa to
go fuck himself in an August 7, 1865, letter:
       To My Old Master, Colonel P. H. Anderson,
       Big Spring, Tennessee
       Sir: I got your letter, and was glad to find that you had not
       forgotten Jourdon, and that you wanted me to come back and
       live with you again, promising to do better for me than anybody
       else can. I have often felt uneasy about you.… Although you
       shot at me twice before I left you, I did not want to hear of your
       being hurt, and am glad you are still living.…
          I want to know particularly what the good chance is you
       propose to give me.…
          Mandy says she would be afraid to go back without some
       proof that you were disposed to treat us justly and kindly; and
       we have concluded to test your sincerity by asking you to send
       us our wages for the time we served you. This will make us
       forget and forgive old scores, and rely on your justice and
       friendship in the future. I served you faithfully for thirty-two
       years, and Mandy twenty years. At twenty-five dollars a month
       for me, and two dollars a week for Mandy, our earnings would
       amount to eleven thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. Add
       to this the interest for the time our wages have been kept back,
       and deduct what you paid for our clothing, and three doctor’s
       visits to me, and pulling a tooth for Mandy, and the balance
       will show what we are in justice entitled to. Please send the
       money by Adams’ Express, in care of V. Winters, Esq., Dayton,
       Ohio. If you fail to pay us for faithful labors in the past, we can
       have little faith in your promises in the future.
That was 1865. Today Black writers, artists, barbers, activists, video
bloggers, Spades champions, and aunties continue to use their legal-for-now
voices to expose the lie of White supremacy, hype up our relatives who
can’t really sing, and kick people out of the race for tomfoolery.
In “Laugh to Keep from Crying,” satirists, stand-up comedians, and
cartoonists explore how we use humor to maintain our culture, sanity,
creativity, and safety, because laughing is one of our most important tools of
war.

## Laughing While Black

## Damon Young

On February 1, 2018, the New York Daily News reported that Patricia
Cummings, a White teacher at Middle School 118 in the Bronx, instructed
three Black students in her class to lie on the floor, and then she stepped on
their backs to teach a lesson about slavery.
If you attempt to reverse-engineer, you could find a series of not-all-thatterribly-racist rationales for Cummings’s decision. This story was reported
by the Daily News on the first day of Black History Month, which often
manifests as a shallow and hysterical salmagundi of contextless tidbits about
traffic lights, peanut butter, and Wilt Chamberlain. Cummings could have
been trying to be creative. Kind of like when you start adding kale and
broccoli to your morning fruit smoothie, except instead of “kale and
broccoli” Cummings added “racism.” Or maybe she planned to rent Glory
from the school’s library, it wasn’t available, and she remembered that scene
where Denzel was whipped because he left camp to find comfortable shoes
and she wanted to show her students how even the most comfortable shoes
can feel uncomfortable if Darth Becky is cartwheeling on your back.
The most likely explanation for Patricia Cummings’s behavior, though, is
that like millions of White people before her, she’s lost her goddamn mind.
The pervasiveness of White supremacy has made White people fucking
crazy. Patricia Cummings is a natural and predictable consequence of what
happens when the possession of Whiteness is so blinding and deafening that
it transmutes White people into baby groundhogs unable to see or feel or
think or smell or taste anything outside of their vacuums of Caucasity.
Sometimes this insanity materializes as boundless and preposterous
entitlement, as was the case with Abigail Fisher, aka “Becky with the Bad
Grades.” If you recall, Fisher is the aggressively pedestrian White woman
who applied to the University of Texas in 2008, was denied admission, and
promptly stated that she was discriminated against because she was White.
Her gripe that the University of Texas had the audacity to treat her Wonder
Bread ass like Wonder Bread instead of a tasty pancake reached the
Supreme Court, where she lost in 2016 as the court finally ruled against her.
(According to court transcripts, an exasperated Justice Sonia Sotomayor
said, “She think she a tasty pancake,” when providing the rationale for the
            *
decision. )
     And sometimes this insanity forces White folks to lie and spin and
gaslight so zealously that they no longer know where the truth ends and
their bullshit begins. There are myriad examples of this. America sits on a
Jenga tower of lies about its inherent goodness, godliness, and manifest
destiny, its “free market” economy, and its “exceptional” history. At the time
of this writing, my favorite recurring example of this happens when
President Donald Trump does or says some demented fuckshit surpassing
the demented fuckshit he did or said the day before, and Sarah Huckabee
Spicer Scaramucci Sanders squiggles out from the Incubus’s lair to triplespeak their president’s actions into something they think is honorable. This
motherfucker could shit on the White House lawn and wipe his ass with a
Polaroid of the Boys Choir of Harlem and within an hour one of his minions
would hold a press conference to state: “The president is just very serious
about going green and conserving energy. Which is exactly what you
liberals and the media have been asking him to do, right?”
     Existing as a Black American while pressed against this force is
terrifying. Not consciously. At least not all of the time. But sometimes,
when stepping back and fully processing the vastness and the depth and the
transcendence of it, it’s not unlike what happens when you accidentally
glance at the sun. And this condition is rage-inducing. It makes you want to
fight sometimes and duck and hide some other times. It makes you want to
be sure you’re holding and hugging and loving the Black people around
because you know they need to be held, hugged, and loved because you do
too, and they’re Black like you. It can, if you allow it, make you so
consumed with a white-hot animus toward them for what they did to you,
and toward people who look like you for what they did to you, and toward
yourself for what they did to you—that it swallows you. You become
ensconced in it.
     Resistance, of course, is vital. And sometimes that resistance looks like
what happens when you plug “resistance” into Thesaurus.com and scan the
most antagonistic results. It’s defiance. It’s friction. It’s blocking. It’s a
struggle. It’s combat. But then sometimes you need to go to Facebook or
GroupMe and send an invite for a game night at your house this weekend.
And you invite all of your best and Blackest friends. And you lure them in
with promises of properly seasoned and appropriately cooked chicken wings
and an array of the brownest of liquors. Maybe you even name the games
you’ll play. Taboo. Cards Against Humanity. Mafia. Spades. And you ask
them to bring nothing except maybe some chips, some juice, and even a
thoroughly vetted friend. And they come, and you have a fucking blast. But
even as you’re playing an especially intense round of Spoons, the real
reason for this gathering lurks beneath the surface and occasionally bubbles
up:
      “Nigga, did I tell you about what Susan in accounting did today?”
      “I swear to God that if Conner brings another Caucasian casserole to the
company potluck I’m gonna choke his Patagonia ass.”
      “White people age like bodega bananas.”
      “Don’t you know this chick French-kissed her Shih Tzu and then tried to
give me a hug? I told her my insurance doesn’t cover White people dog
cooties.”
      Sometimes these jokes turn into a morbid and numbing reminder of
exactly how unwelcoming and dangerous it can be to exist while Black in
America:
      “Ayyiyo, who’s on y’all’s ‘I Just Got Pulled over by the Cops for No
Reason and I Need to Hurry and Put Something Nonthreatening on My
Stereo’ playlists? Mine has Taylor Swift, Creed, and the Golden Girls theme
song.”
      One of the reasons that existing while Black in America can be
exhausting is that it entails an endless search for safe spaces and
opportunities to exhale. But once that space and that oxygen is found,
perhaps at a game night or during a flag football outing or maybe just on a
sparsely populated Twitter timeline, sometimes the best and only thing to do
is make fun of these mindless motherfuckers with no worries.
      There will always be time to be sober and serious. But sometimes
finding a way to ridicule a Patricia Cummings, an Abigail Fisher, or a Darth
Chad provides a necessary catharsis. A moment of respite when you
recognize how you’ve been forced to be fully human in a way they’ll never
be, when you become tickled with the irony of them considering themselves
to be the superior ones. And then sometimes the laughter itself becomes a
weaponized tool, a vital piece of resistance-encouraging and Whitenesswithstanding hardware that allows you to love Blackness even harder and
louder and longer than you did before. Maybe they’ve lost their goddamn
minds. But our humor keeps that from being contagious.

## Dismantling White Comfort Is Our Wakanda

## Russ Green

If you come see me perform, we gon’ talk about some shit.
As a stand-up comedian, when I walk onstage, my intention is to
question everything. Why are we walking around acting like we have a
government? Do Black lives really matter? How am I supposed to raise
children when it’s illegal to be Black in public? These questions need
answers. I’m on a mission to find the truth, and I invite the audience to join
me on the journey. If it goes well, it’s liberating for everyone, and if not—at
least no one got shot.
It doesn’t always go well. I’ve been accused of being anti-White, which
is absurd. I don’t hate White people; I hate the idea of Whiteness, a social
construct that entitles people to live rich fulfilling lives as long as their skin
is absent of melanin.
The reality is that if jokes that call out the societal ills associated with
White supremacy make you uncomfortable, you are probably complicit in
upholding the institution. I would imagine the opportunity to elevate your
consciousness and awareness would be cathartic, like a warm rain to wash
away your obliviousness to your privilege. But my White hecklers say
otherwise.
I hear people say all the time that comedians are fearless. I’ll take it, I
guess, though I’m not blocking highway traffic in protest, investigating
corrupt police officers, or blowing the whistle on corporate greed or sellout
politicians. People don’t send me death threats or deliver explosive packages
to my front door.
The bravest part of my evening is when I leave the comedy club, get into
my car, and drive home in the middle of the night. The reality is, there is
always a chance that I will never make it. Once, after a show, I made a pit
stop at Taco Bell—the one true king of late night grub—and was pulled
over by a cop who claimed I had a taillight out.
The moment the squad car started trailing me, I thought, Fuck. Then the
dormant respectability Negro voice in my head started cataloging all the
things I did wrong that night. First mistake: Leave home. Second: Drive car.
Third: Be Black.
Driving while Black is scary. The fear of being pulled over is so extreme
that when sirens go off during songs on my playlist, my heart races. I
shouldn’t be as afraid of police officers as I am of sharks, but to my ears,
blaring sirens sound like the Jaws theme song. So when I looked in my
rearview mirror to confirm that I was indeed being pursued by a known
superpredator, I was equal parts afraid and furious—I was five minutes
from my house.
The Bagger Vance in my head assured me that if I simply relaxed and
remained rational as the officer approached my vehicle, the Dirty Harry in
his head wouldn’t be saying, “Go ahead, make my day.” The officer opened
with, “Is this your vehicle?”—standard-issue microaggression. I confirmed
it was by handing him my license and registration. A beat passed, then the
officer stopped blinding me with his Maglite and instructed: “Wait here. If
everything checks out, you’ll be on your way soon.”
I’m fairly certain officers write 1,500-word essays while reviewing your
driving record. In the time it takes them to figure out the perfect ending
(will this be a comedy or dramatic thriller?), I’m usually playing through
Choose Your Own Adventure scenarios, hoping I stumble on the right
sequence of page turns that lands me safe in my bed. Turns out my third
taillight, the one that’s near the roof, was out and I found myself “fortunate”
enough to go home with a warning.
My XXL Grilled Stuft Burrito with Fire Sauce was bittersweet that
night, and the Wild Cherry Pepsi couldn’t wash down the realization that
things could have ended calamitously. Unlike Sandra Bland and Philando
Castile, the patron saints of traumatic social media clips, I made it to my
house, exhaled deeply, and kept breathing. I sat in my car, finished my junk
food, calmed my nerves, planned my trip to AutoZone, and thanked God
that I was pulled over and not my wife. She can’t die—somebody has to take
care of all these kids.
What compels me—a husband and father of four—to leave the safety of
my house to tell jokes for strangers? I have no idea. What punchline is worth
dying for? The risk of making people uncomfortable by telling my truths
should be worth more than the reward of validation from people I will never
see again.
But is what I do any more ridiculous than walking around pretending
that we don’t see the daily injustices Black people experience? Are White
folks’ ears too fragile to hear a narrative that differs from theirs? Are we
only allowed to be free in our own homes, as long as those homes aren’t in
predominantly White neighborhoods? Not on my watch, fam.
We underestimate the value of Black joy; it should appraise much higher.
It is imperative that we experience more than pain. Maybe that’s why I’m
drawn to perform. I get to be in service of Black joy in a communal setting,
initiating boundless conversations where my premises construct new
realities. It’s straight up carefree, liberated hysterics—our own little
Wakanda. Fuck the colonizer’s feelings; I risked my life to tell these jokes.

## Challenges the Concept of Whiteness

I fight White supremacy by existing in the unabashed way that I do, as a
creative and as a speaker, and I encourage others to do the same. I also work
to make White Americans denounce their Whiteness.
I always say there’s only two kinds of White people: those who are
White, and those who happen to be White. And so I challenge White people
with that question on a regular basis: “Do you define yourself by your
Whiteness?” And when they fire back and say, “Well, do you define yourself
by your Blackness?” I say, “They’re not the same thing. Whiteness was
created for the purpose of oppression. Blackness was created in spite of
oppression. We’re not coming from the same place, so don’t try to conflate
equality where it does not exist.” In my talks at universities, I’m inserting
this real questioning of White people to no longer just question racism as a
concept, but to question their own positioning within that and how that
affects what they’re doing. We have to start having conversations that are
different than the ones we’ve been having. I talk about racism of course,
because it’s real. But I accompany it with what I feel could be possible.
A Eulogy for the White Gaze: A Tale from the Future

## Jamilah-Asali Lemieux

The year is 2080, and Black people are finally free. Yes, really. It’s true!
I know, I know.
You want me to tell you everything so you can go and get things started,
but I can only give you these seeds to plant, the seeds that will grow the
revolu—just listen.
Certainly, you recognize the absurdity of challenging the authenticity of
someone’s Negritude based on their particular dialect—or the absence of
one. You know that “real” Black people can prefer rock (which is African at
the root) or rap (which was decidedly African until around the late-aughts,
when our folks gave the mic to every tattooed druggie who wanted a piece).
You certainly realize that Black cannot be vanquished by an inability to
dance or a dislike of soul food.
However, in your day, there were some cultural markers so linked to our
experience in the Western world that, well, we couldn’t rightly say you were
really Black without having encountered them.
Prior to the, umm, liberation, it would have been virtually impossible to
be a Black person raised in the United States who had never heard or uttered
some variation of a common African American proverb:
Don’t embarrass me in front of these White folks.
I talked about this with a group of kids just the other day, and they
couldn’t fathom the idea of being concerned with how they behaved in the
presence of White people, let alone having that concern presented as a
mandate from someone who loves them. They really don’t know how good
they have it.
Yes, I’m serious. We don’t say that shit anymore, ever. Okay, no more
questions or I’m done talking.
Back when I was young, the White gaze was often one of the most
difficult places that a Black person could find themselves in, and God forbid
you ever did something to make a Black elder who had lived through Jim
Crow feel even more uncomfortable while there. As I explained to those
kids, the DEMIFOTWF rule was so much more complicated than the
language may have indicated. It’s super-easy to assume that it was little
more than older Black folks assigning undue value to the thoughts and
feelings of White people.
Among some of the likely circumstances that might summon such a
command:
     Acting like “you ain’t never been nowhere before” at a nice restaurant,
     department store, gas station, city bus, or anywhere they may be
     watching—especially when you were in the minority in said location;
     Cutting up at school and forcing your mama to leave her job and be
     scolded by some White folks essentially telling her that she failed as a
     parent;
        Doing anything that was a painful reminder of racism, like ordering
        fried chicken and watermelon in their presence, or using terms like
        “baby mama,” “ghetto,” and the “n-word” in mixed company.
Yes, I said “the n-word.” I can’t say the real version because that word is
totally banned now. No one says it and if you say it again, I swear I’m done
talking.
Thus, “Don’t embarrass me in front of these White folks” wasn’t a plea;
it was a universal rule that Black folks had better not run afoul of. The “me”
most often was a woman (your mother, grandmother, auntie, play-auntie,
godmother) or any other trusted authority figure. But it could be any other
Negro on the planet. Hell, it could be yourself, your internal monologue
cautioning you against setting everyone back by doing some totally human
shit.
As you know, Black folks’ obsession with decorum had its roots in being
told that we were inherently broken. That we were three-fifths of a person.
That we were unintelligent, unsophisticated savages in need of constant
correction. If the people who had enslaved us had constructed an idea of
Blackness vile enough to justify lording over us for centuries, what might
they do when we provided actual evidence of some sort of shortcoming?
Our elders felt like they had no choice but to prove White folks wrong
early and often. Absent the empowerment to go to war or simply say “no
more,” the best they had was to embody the goodness they believed we
lacked.
They said we were dirty, and so we obsessed over the cleanliness of our
homes and bodies, so much so that we’d put toxic shit like baby powder and
douches in our most intimate places in order to refute that.
They said we were sexually deviant, so we policed our own desires so
rigidly that our only release would come via shouting and hollering in
churches built as monuments to White gods.
They said we were too loud, and so we tried to shrink in their presence,
tried to speak softly and be less vibrant. Most of us never mastered this one,
thankfully.
It wasn’t until we truly recognized the hypocrisy of their gaze that we
finally broke free of its cold, steely hold on our lives.
We were dirty, but compared to whom? Surely not those folks we saw
kissing their dogs on the mouth at the park, the people who went on social
media to defend taking showers without washcloths, that infamous woman
on the internet cooking without the slightest bit of concern for the littercaked cat paws that walked through her casserole pan just moments prior.
(We still joke about these things, but dammit, it stings!)
If we were both sexually irrepressible and immoral, why couldn’t they
keep their hands off our bodies, in every sense of the phrase, for centuries?
Our women were beneath their standards of femininity, yet White
mothers outsourced the rearing of their children to us from the moment we
arrived on these shores—and would later begin to emulate our hairstyles,
modes of dress, and even the shape of our bodies. Our men were somehow
shiftless and lazy, but also terrifyingly powerful and strong? That math
doesn’t add up.
Around 2014, the term “respectability politics” ventured outside of the
academy and entered the regular Black people lexicon. This was a good
thing. Ideas that can improve our overall quality of life are pretty useless if
they aren’t made accessible to the masses. The better our people understood
why they’d been taught to contort their humanity to weather the whims of
White folks, the easier it would be for them to divorce those unhealthy
habits, right?
However, as these things tend to go, it didn’t take long for some young
people to confuse having any sort of behavioral standard with “tap-dancing
for massa” like a self-hating “coon.” This caused some of our elders to
suffer some serious discomfort as a number of Black kids willfully gave
them their asses to kiss in an effort to, well, give White folks their asses to
kiss. The rebellion against respectability politics was a complicated one, but
ultimately it pushed our people in the right direction: toward a standard of
behavior that centered our own ideals and identities.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration would inspire two very different
reactions among our now-former oppressors that would power the beginning
of the end to our traditional respectability politics—and set the stage for the
revolution that finally saw us get free.
Scores of White kids proudly emulated the boorish behavior of the
unapologetically racist, sexist, and charmless forty-fifth president of the
United States. This was a pretty understandable reaction: if someone can
make it to the highest office in the land by acting like a petulant child and
claiming superiority over other groups, why not indulge in all the antisocial
behavior you could ever dream of ? White privilege is a hell of a drug.
Meanwhile, equally large groups of White young people were so turned
off by Donald Trump and his ilk that they would form the largest group of
progressive White folks that the United States had ever seen. Like, for real
progressive—nothing like those “White moderates” that Martin Luther
King Jr. identified in his famed 1963 “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” as
“the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom.”
As a result, Black millennial and Generation Y parents were less
inclined to caution their own children against shaming themselves (and their
families) in the presence of the melanin-deficient because they had less to
prove to them than ever. How self-conscious can you actually be in the
presence of pussy-grabbers who don’t even believe in truth, human rights,
and washcloths? And the White folks on the other side of the political aisle
were so deeply—and rightly!—ashamed of their own kind that they didn’t
dare parrot the sort of judgment and contempt that their parents had once
used against Black folks.
Many of our people had started to resemble what Dr. King said about
those White moderates, “more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice,” so I gotta
give some props to both the radical Caucasian defectors who sought to shed
their privilege like dead skin and the MAGA-hat motherfuckers who clung
to theirs for dear life. Without both, we might not have ever gotten to the
point when we were ready for revolution.
Of course, it was young Black folks who actually led the charge, starting
with…
No, no. I want to tell you, seriously. I wish I could say more about how it
all went down, but I can’t. And we’re out of time. You have to go back home
now. Don’t cry! You’ll be fine and we need you to be fine. We need you to get
your folks ready so that this world exists someday. I can’t tell you how to do
that, but I can offer this one last bit of advice:
We move differently without our chains. Pretend yours are gone, and
they will be someday.

Ben Passmore Is Not Interested in Your Space Coffee Shop
Don’t get him wrong—your café in the sky might be spectacularly
rendered. But cartoonist Ben Passmore would much rather make art that
pisses off racist trolls in all corners of the internet. Here, the Your Black
Friend author talks to Kenrya about his creative foundation, why he puts
himself in his art, and the tradition he’d like to see flourish.
When did you realize that you were an artist?
I guess I’ve always known. My mom paints and sculpts, and as far back
as I can remember she had me drawing on placemats and scraps of paper.
It’s weird, but I started making my own toys at like six, seven, eight.
Everyone wanted GI Joes and stuff, but we couldn’t afford it. So I’d make
my own. It was very sad, but I was super into it.
What were you making them out of?
It was napkins and tape at first. And then I was making them out of—
you know those ties you get off bread? They come in lots of different colors
and are very flexible. I’d make them out of those and pieces of plastic.
Word! So how would you describe your aesthetic these days?
Someone said that I was both quintessentially millennial and nihilistic,
which maybe fits. I make Black punk comics.
Do you identify as a Black punk?
I did. I had already been disappointing women with my terrible haircut
and ratty clothes for a while when Afropunk popped up. But it got sexy
when I was in my late twenties. So I have some resentment about that. I
don’t identify as a punk now, though. I realized subcultures have a tendency
to repeat the fails of the mainstream.
How do your Black punk comics fight White supremacy?
My hope is that what I do inspires people to act, or at least to think about
contending with White supremacy in ways that seem intentional and sort of
fun. It feels like we really need people out here just being brave, people who
will go out and confront racists. There’s a long history of punks chasing
skinheads and Nazis out of their communities, and I feel like it’s a good
tradition. I would like to see it keep on going.
You often put yourself in your work. Why?
I think I did it at first because I didn’t know a whole lot of people like
me. I didn’t know a whole lot of Black punks who squatted in abandoned
buildings and valued living more freely rather than spending a lot of time
working, people who lived outside of society in the same way. So it was
self-affirming to write about myself and sort of process. And also, Black
people are often presented two-dimensionally in comics. A Black man is
just a big aggro man with a gun. I really wanted to make comics about
someone who was complicated and not masculine in these very contrived
ways.
You’re talented, right? You can draw literally anything. So why
do you do this work that brings racists to your mentions?
It doesn’t really feel like a choice to me. I can’t imagine going off and
writing about, I don’t know, space people operating a coffee shop or
something. Or drawing Mickey Mouse. Even though I guess technically he
is a Blackface character, so that would still be related, now that I think of it.
We live immersed in White supremacy. And I’d rather not. But as long as
it’s something that we’re subjected to, I want to write about fighting it in
ways that feel inspiring.
My Dad Loves Popeyes Organizations and I Love My Dad

## Kiese Laymon

Ben Carson is not my father. Ben Carson is My Dad. Earlier today, My
Dad was tongue-lashed by this Golden Girls cousin–looking White woman
on national TV. My Dad said it’s harder to make him the victim of a hightech lynching if he doesn’t have a neck, so he successfully made his neck the
opposite of erect.
My Dad is hilarious. I love My Dad.
Right before the high-tech lynching, My Dad gave back over $30,000
worth of love seats, waterbeds, lotion dispensers, and butter knives he
bought for Mama. Right after the high-tech lynching, My Dad told me that
the entire political charade was an inevitable consequence of working for
Uncle D to The. “It’s a witch hunt,” My Dad said from the passenger seat of
his Lexus. “But niggas gotta eat, son. And we eating so good, son.” This is
how My Dad talks in his Lexus, the bedroom he shares with Mama, and the
basement of our six-story home that is five stories bigger than yours.
My Dad’s skin is so supple. I love My Dad.
When My Dad gets embarrassed on TV or in print, he likes to eat at
Popeyes organizations. I stayed out in the car while My Dad walked into the
Popeyes organization on the corner of Jackson Avenue and Highway 6. As
soon as My Dad walked in, I could see My Dad get swarmed by Black folks
fiending for selfies and autographs. The Black patrons of the Popeyes
organization looked longingly into My Dad’s eyes, surprised that My Dad
was so handsome, so fine.
I love My Dad.
All of a sudden, I saw that something near the cash register had the
attention of the Black patrons of this Popeyes organization. Three people
ran out of the Popeyes organization yelling, “They shooting,” and, “Chile,
somebody ’bout to shoot Ben Carson up in Popeyes,” into their cell phones.
My Dad was no longer in my line of vision, but I wasn’t worried. I know
from previous trips to other Popeyes organizations that when Black folk run
out saying, “They shooting,” and, “Chile, somebody ’bout to shoot Ben
Carson,” there are rarely shots and no one is ever actually attempting to
shoot My Dad.
Still, I slid My Dad’s semiautomatic weapon into the back of my
waistband, got out of our Lexus, and burst through the doors of the Popeyes
organization to see what high jinks the Black patrons in the Popeyes
organization were up to.
Two cashiers, surrounded by at least sixteen Black patrons in the
Popeyes organization, were six inches from each other, arguing loudly. Both
held their left hand in their right fist until it was time to make their most
effective points. I considered the hand gestures quite Negroid.
“You see that fruit punch?” the short cashier with the long ashy neck
said to the tall cashier with wet lips. “That fruit punch ain’t just make itself.
See how that shit cascade up, down, all around that container? That shit
ain’t cascading ’cause it want to cascade. I made that shit cascade. When I
got here, that shit was just sitting in basic white pitchers. No kind of style.
Fuck is wrong with you questioning my Employee of the Week status?”
“Right, right,” the cashier with the juicy wet lips said back to the cashier
with the ashy neck. “You see that shine on them biscuits, though? Do you
see that shine, nigga? That’s all I’m asking. Do you see that shine? I ain’t
met nan biscuit that woke up this morning and said, ‘Let me bathe myself in
this regal-ass butter before I start my day.’ I did that shit. And I learned to
paint with butter interning at Red Lobster, Papa John’s, and then at the
movies. Ten years it took me to learn my craft. I brought that biscuit fashion
here. When I got here, you know good and well that the butter was in the
biscuit batter. Wasn’t no kinds of shine. Am I lying?”
“She ain’t lying,” a few folks from the kitchen said to each other. “She
did do that.”
“Brothers and sisters,” My Dad said to both workers in slow-bop publictalk style. “As I’m sure you know, I would never ever support a living wage,
but please know how much I appreciate your labor. You are all Employees
of the Week to me. That cascading fruit punch, there’s nothing better when
my throat is parched. That buttered coating on those rolls, it is really some
kind of exquisite.”
No one corrected My Dad when he called a biscuit a roll. I love My Dad.
Both cashiers came around in front of the counter. I thought My Dad and
I were going to have to fight some Blacks at the Popeyes organization by the
look of their eyes. But we didn’t. The cashiers hugged My Dad’s neck, took
more selfies, and apologized. My Dad told the cashiers that strange things
happened every time he entered a Popeyes organization. Then he made me
go out to his Lexus and get his bag. My Dad calls his bag his “grip.”
When My Dad placed the grip on the counter and unzipped it, I saw
thousands of Amazon gift cards. “I’m going to leave these with you people
on the condition that no one in here tells anyone in the media where you got
these. If I hear on the news that I blessed your rusted working hands with
these gift cards, I will be forced to immediately cut off service to these

## cards. Let’s go, son.”

On the way out of the Popeyes organization, the cashier with the wet
juicy lips asked the cashier with the long ashy neck if My Dad was saying
“rusted” or “rusty” or “rustic.”
“Rusted,” I told the cashiers. “My Dad called your Black working hands
‘rusted.’”
I love My Dad.
My Dad and I were in the Lexus for fifteen minutes before either of us
said a word. “You ever think it’s strange,” I asked him, “how Black working
people call you all kinds of names on the internet, but every time we run
into Black working people in real life, it’s like they love you?”
“Niggas love me,” My Dad said to me. “Why is that strange to you?”
“Yeah,” I told My Dad. “I mean, why do you think they’re so nice to you
in person, but…”
“Because they know,” My Dad said.

## “They know what?”

“They know niggas gotta eat. They know a hustle when they feel one.
They know a hustler when they see one. They know this is all bullshit. Same

## reason they loved Obama.”

“What’s bullshit? And Obama, he loved them, or at least acted like he
loved them.”
“Right. That was his hustle, son. Niggas loved that hustle.”
“So Black people will love any Black person who hustles themselves to
the national political stage?”
“You gotta be hated by White folks for us to really support you,” My
Dad told me. “We love a clean nigga hated by White folks. But even if
you’re loved by White folks like me, privately, niggas know the hustle. This
ain’t new, son.”
“But if you could get love by loving Black people, why make hating, or
hating on, Black people part of your public performance and hustle?”
“Two reasons,” My Dad said. “One is that White money spends way
better than Black love. Black love ain’t buying us no leather couches, no
leather coats, no leather pants, no fine cutlery. I been successful since you
were born. Have we ever ate as good as we eating since I started really
fucking with these racist-ass White folks? If all these brothers out here
slanging little dime bags decided to use their little platforms to shit on
niggas and hoist up White folks, do you know how much better they’d be
eating?”

## “Not really.”

“Exactly. Second, it’s all about suicide bombing, son.”

## “What you mean?”

“I mean, people think this political apparatus is about greed. Maybe. But
it’s really about old-ass White people not being okay with just harming
themselves. Why is there a minimum age requirement for the presidency but
no maximum age limit, son? These old wealthy White motherfuckers want
to hurt themselves by applying for jobs that will kill them faster, but they
want to hurt us too. They hate themselves. They hate us too, though. And
then they hate the country by extension.”

## “Hillary Clinton?”

## “Lackluster-ass suicide bomber.”

## “Biden?”

## “Lazy-ass suicide bomber.”

## “Bernie?”

“Loud-talking, one trick pony-ass suicide bomber,” My Dad said. “Look.
Did you see a seventy-five-year-old working at Popeyes or anywhere you
have to actually do work?”

## “No, I didn’t.”

“Exactly. Do you see any niggas lucky enough to make it to seventy-five
fiending to be president of anything? Niggas who make it to seventy-five
with money are trying to sit they ass down somewhere, watch some Family
Feud, and not lose they money. The last thing I want at seventy-five years
old is the hardest job in the world.”
“That explains them,” I told My Dad. “But what explains you?”
“I’m a nigga. I look good, but I’m old. I gotta eat,” My Dad said as we
pulled into the driveway of our house that is five stories bigger than yours.

## “That explains me.”

We sat out in the garage. I looked out the front windshield as My Dad
finished eating the life out of his last Popeyes biscuit. My Dad asked me
why I looked so confused.
“Don’t be confused, son,” My Dad said. “The question is how healthy
can a nation be when its racial majority’s appetite for Black, Brown,
Muslim, and nasty women’s suffering is literally insatiable? For real, this is
really one of the only questions that matters. As long as that appetite can’t
be quenched, hating on niggas will always be a thorough hustle. And this,”
My Dad said, “is a question with an answer that will never qualify as

## Breaking News, son.”

Earlier this summer, My Dad and I took a road trip across country in his
Lexus where he told me everything that was going to happen to D to The’s
administration. While I was watching a fifty-four-inch television on the
twenty-sixth floor of a Mississippi Gulf Coast casino, Boyz II Men were on
television singing to a White woman with an apparent belly full of gas. I felt
so much shame for Boyz II Men. But like My Dad said, niggas gotta eat.
When the commercial went off, there was Breaking News that My Dad
already predicted.
A man who looks like an American Psycho remix of That ’80s Guy from
Futurama was enjoying telling reporters how much “respect” he has for
Sean Spicer and how much “love” he has for D to The. The American ’80s
Psycho Guy kept saying, “One more question. Should we do one more?
Let’s do one more.” My Dad said that American ’80s Psycho Guy loved
attention too much to be good at anything that required listening. Like D to
The, he seemed to lack shame, humility, home-training. But unlike D to
The, he could be fired. My Dad said he would not last a week.
Later that night, while I was on one of the beds looking up YouTube
videos and My Dad was brushing his waves in the hotel bathroom, Ced the
Entertainer came on the television over-enunciating every syllable while
earnestly looking at the camera talking about My Dad’s “diabetic nerve
pain.” I felt so much shame for Ced the Entertainer. But I understood.
Niggas gotta eat, and My Dad has diabetic nerve pain too.
Near the end of our road trip, I asked My Dad how anyone who had ever
seen the tens of thousands of empty United States miles could talk about
building a wall to keep people out. “White folks love to keep darker people
out of things, son,” My Dad said. “And as long as this shit is true, someone

## will capitalize on that. This ain’t new.”

All of a sudden, there was Breaking News on SiriusXM. Mueller
apparently convened a grand jury. I looked at My Dad and waited for him to
say something. My Dad looked afraid. Eventually, he said, “Oh well. Guess
this shit will be ending sooner than I thought. Barack Obama was the best
president White folks ever had, son. He just was. The nigga was hired to
clean up their mess. He cleaned that shit up. In way more ways than White
folks on the left and right want to admit, he saved them. Saved their jobs.
Saved their retirements. Saved their health care system. Saved their country.
And what do most of them do? They despise him for it.”
I asked My Dad if he felt that way, why was he working for Uncle D to
The? My Dad just looked at me without blinking, and this was hard because
My Dad blinks more than you. My Dad sucked his teeth. My Dad ran his
palm over his waves. “My bad,” I told My Dad. “Because niggas gotta eat,
right?”
“What in the world am I doing?” My Dad said to himself. “What in the

## world am I doing?”

That was then.
Tonight we are home from a trek to the Popeyes organization on Jackson
and Highway 6. “Donald is in trouble, and when this is all done, he will
eventually be destroyed not because of what he’s done to vulnerable
Mexicans, Muslims, White women, queer folk, poor folk, and Black folk in
this country, and not because his White ass conflates the health of his
reputation with the health of the country,” My Dad says as we sit in the
Lexus. “That mediocre man is headed toward absolute destruction because
of money laundering, conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and really because
of what he dared to say about the media and the intelligence community
while working with, and really for, Vladimir.”
“Right,” I tell My Dad. “But what about you? Aren’t we eating good
enough? Can’t you walk away and spend the rest of your retirement at home

## singing and eating that dark meat with Mama?”

    My Dad ignores my question and gets out of the Lexus. As we walk
through the door, he says, “There is no clean work for any Black person in
this country who wants to be rich.”
    “Is there clean work in this country for any Black person who wants to
be free or healthy?”
    My Dad is standing in the kitchen. He’s looking me directly in the eye. I
see My Dad thinking, wondering, wandering. “There is cleaner work at that
Popeyes organization,” My Dad tells me. “But who would you rather be? A
clean, hungry, Black rusted hands–having nigga who works at a Popeyes
organization, or a rich, sellout-ass nigga who stays full like us?”
    I love My Dad too much to answer his question. My Dad loves me too
much to wait for an answer. I look down at both of our hands. Our palms are

    “Us,” I finally tell My Dad while he is laying his head in Mama’s lap
eating that dark meat, tears sliding down his beautiful face. “Right,” My
Dad says. “I’d rather be us because we are eating. We are compromised, but
so are all niggas. And so are all Americans. But niggas gotta eat. And we
are eating so well.”
    I love My Dad.

## QUESTION, ANSWERED

    Here we consider the question: how does humor inform the way you
move through the world?

## Kenrya

You know those sad clowns? The ones with the red lipstick smeared
down to their chins, the painted-on furrowed brows, and the scraggly orange
hair grazing their collars? The ones who make people cringe and titter
uncomfortably as they recognize their own pathos in their downer oneliners?
I’m not one of those.
I’m more like: Where does she keep digging up these Black-ass gifs?
Yup, she’s right, that is a word, bitch, your auntie is hella shady funny. As
my Bumble connects know, my hobbies include baking, reading, getting lost
in Twitter black holes, and talking shit both inside and outside. My texts are
full of side eyes, laughing so hard they’re crying faces and skulls, ’cause I
stay killing it in my “this seat’s taken”–ass group texts. And I’ve been
known to earnestly describe myself as a funny bitch, ’cause, Aries.
My sister Leena has been a victim of and party to my bullshit her whole
life, and I’m more than happy to put on a show for her, my first and best
audience. We were downloading about our day last night, she taking a break
during her shift as an emergency medical technician, me cleaning my
kitchen before bed.
“So we’re sitting in the antiracist, antibias training that I helped organize
at the school, and the facilitators are talking about the history of race, who
created the concept, how they used propaganda to spread it, all that. And out
of nowhere this old White dude raises his hand as they are presenting and
just starts talking on some ‘fuck yo’ presentation’ shit. He’s like, ‘But Black
people have been enslaving and killing each other for years, all over the
world. What does that have to do with White people? We didn’t do that to
them, they did that to themselves.’ Bitchhhhhh. I couldn’t have stopped
myself from yelling, ‘Are you kidding me?’ if I wanted to; they’re lucky I
didn’t cuss. Meanwhile, the head of the school looked horrified, a few folks
near me fidgeted mad uncomfortably, and the Black mama sitting beside me
was telepathically communicating that we might need to morph into the
Dora Milaje and fuck shit up. And I was with her, but I was also thinking,
Lord, can you please tell me who this racist motherfucker is in case Saa
wants to have a playdate with his kid? Like, really, b? Your trash-bag ass
might as well have stayed at home if you were gonna bring this shit in here.

## The fucking Caucasity.”

It should be noted that Leena started tittering around the time I got to
“old White dude,” and was full on cackling when I lamented the Caucasian
audacity of it all. The laugh helped her get through a long shift and gave me
an opportunity to vent my annoyance and horror that my child might come
across this man on the playground.
Because trauma—whether it’s the type whose scars disfigure our bodies
and psyches in an instant or over time—is a motherfucker, and I think we all
know that comedy is often the show we put on to convince ourselves that we
are “Dy-no-mite!” Those sad clowns know it. Our ancestors who made fun
of massa in the moonlight knew it. But knowing that laughter is a mask for
our agony doesn’t shrink its impact.
In a world that gobbles up Black pain, there is something luxurious
about spinning the blocked hair touches and outright bigotry into stories
that start with “Niggggaaaaaaa” and end with your sister not being able to
catch her breath because “How dare you?!” Those tears of laughter you’re
wiping away? They seep back into your body and heal the abrasions your
heart collected during your morning commute that included the man who
decided his bag deserved a seat on the crowded subway car more than you
did. That scream laugh you let out when Kid Fury read the White man
outside the expensive theater who assumed he must be waiting there to sell
him weed? It clears your skin and fills in your edges. The joy that collects in
your body when you hear “Harrison Booth” say that he wears “a thick
brown leather belt” to express himself as a White man on that very special
episode of Atlanta? It presses Pause on your anxiety and gives you
permission to step away from your constant vigilance.
When we allow laughter in, we unfold, relax our shoulders, loosen our
limbs, release our tongues, throw off the invisible cloak of respectability,
and feel rejuvenated enough to head back into battle, heads high.
It lets us return to ourselves.

## Akiba

One time I went on a magazine job interview where the Black guy doing
the hiring asked me, “Are you even funny?” This was a trick question. First
of all, a job applicant declaring that she is funny suggests that she is ready
to bust out her best material over a haphazardly toasted conference-room
bagel and tap water. Wocka, wocka nah.
Second of all, this dude had already made it clear that he didn’t think I
was right for the job. To him I was the constipated hall monitor, the sooty
Tipper Gore, that bitch who would invade and neutralize the locker room
atmosphere of his workplace. I don’t remember how I responded to his
question, but what I know for sure is that what I said was flaccid.
At the pre–social media time of this interview, there were next to no
outlets for a droll Black girl to shine on her own terms. And I cared too
much about what men thought of me. So young Akiba actually saw his
question as a flaw in my personal brand. If this particular cornrock didn’t
think I was funny, that meant that the satirical and biting writing I was
becoming known for didn’t land right.
At this point I guess I should explain why being Black and funny meant
and means so much to me. I do this with trepidation because I decided early
in my career that I would never serve as a translator. This mapping-out is
only okay because Zora Neale Hurston famously said, “I love myself when I
am laughing… and then again when I am looking mean and impressive.”
Zora already told us the entire thing! Laughing? Mean and impressive?
Same difference.
The long version: For a people who were seized and stripped of our
bodily autonomy, our history, culture, language, and traditions, humor has
always been a way for us to touch and care for one another. Laughing is an
underground railroad for those of us lucky enough to ride its tracks, the
vehicle through which we have mushed you in your savage face for
murdering us because you are a land-thieving lazy ass who believed that
something called God told you to kidnap, dehumanize, and torture other
people into doing your fucking farming, child care, and nation-building.
In today’s context, humor is how we tell our coworkers that we are codeswitching rather than telling all the family secrets. From Jourdon Anderson
to Moms Mabley to Donald Glover, Black humor that does not explain itself
is the marrow of our tradition.
As I’ve written elsewhere in this book, I was raised Black nationalist in
West Philadelphia in the ’70s and ’80s. If you’ve spent any time with these
beautiful, committed, brilliant folks, you know that irreverence is not
necessarily the goal. If Baba el-Something called everybody at the program
a bunch of sellout Negros, that charge would be entertained.
Also, the fonts of the movement were very severe. This meant that 98
percent of the people who took the flyer about the program already agreed
with us. Despite the near 100 percent buy-in, Mama Somebody was still
going to deliver her 7,000-minute address about buying Black (we already
did this) and learning who we were (that’s why we were at the program).
Then would come Baba Two Times telling us to throw out the White man’s
TV (no).
At one gathering, someone who very likely had PTSD from the Vietnam
War, COINTELPRO, Reaganomics, or all three yelled at us children about
how we needed to learn how to eat roaches and rats because that was going
to be our diet during the revolution. No adult that I know of said, “N***a,
this is the worst recruitment method ever.” Or, “Do we really plan on losing
that badly?”
This daunting thing could have flattened me, except humor is such a
huge part of my family culture and resistance.
My mother, father, and sister, my aunts, uncles, and cousins, and my
crazy grandma Mamie know (or knew, for the homies who aren’t here) that
real laughter is non-negotiable if you are to beat White supremacy. A major
component of enslaving Black folks was keeping us terrified at the whims
of untalented and ridiculous White people.
Part of how we survived lies in how and why we laugh. I’m not a
sociologist, anthropologist, or psychiatrist. But I do know that Black hilarity
heals. On lock, we have deadpan, absurdity, signifying, one-liners, tall tales,
the dozens, silly faces, bizarre inventions, shit-talking, and pretending not to
know the names of people we don’t like, like your girl Whatsherface from
that Rick Ross video who was in Clueless that one time.
My favorite joke from my father involves a family friend who always
rocked his fraternity’s paraphernalia at holiday dinners, including purple
and gold beaded necklaces. Once, as my baba helped set the table, he asked,
“Is Mardi Gras coming?” then pantomimed flashing his nonexistent breasts.
My favorite mom humor is her calling every talented Black male my age
or younger a sibling. “Your new brother Hazim,” she said of a Black
academic who came to dinner after winning a prestigious prize. “Your
brother Damon is hilarious!” says Mom of a popular writer from Pittsburgh.
“I love your brother Ta-Nehisi’s new book,” she will say of a friend from
Howard University. Really, she just wanted a boy.
    My sister cracks me up so much, it’s hard to pull up a good example. My
current favorite is a text involving “unresolved feelings about Drake.” Get
it? Somebody who is not Aubrey Graham has a lot of feelings! Wocka
wocka!
    So no laugh-deficient hiring manager can stop my shine. I have a tribe
that seems to find me amusing and understand why that even matters in the
world. My 1,875 Oldbook and 4,273 Twitter followers indicate that at least
6,148 people could be chuckling at my cat jokes and pictures of my ugly
writing socks. I do this for the people. It is the people who shall determine
whether or not I deserve a pie in the face or a genuine laugh. The laugh is
one of my life’s best rewards.

* I have no proof of this happening.

## FOUR

## I’M NOT ONE OF YOUR LITTLE

## FRIENDS

Have you ever spent a substantial amount of time around a tiny human? Not “I’m the auntie who pops in for a couple hours once a year” time, but
wiping butts, building castles, and catching sneezes in your mouth time. If
so, then you know that those little people are positively aspirational when it
comes to the art of not giving a fuck. They don’t need T-shirts or memes
that proclaim their willingness to do and say exactly what they want; their
lives are testaments to their philosophy.
Not here for somebody’s overdose of perfume at church? Scream that it’s
making it hard to breathe just as the choir finishes singing “Now Behold the
Lamb.” Incredulous that a man two parking spots over just swept garbage
off his raggedy passenger seat and onto the ground? Gon’ head and loudly
tell Mama that “He needs to take better care of the earth!” Not feeling the
guy in the White House? Inform your classmates over lunch that he doesn’t
like them because they are brown and offer up your strategy for making him
be nicer. (Hint: it involves personally presenting him with a letter of advice
and taking Mama along for backup in case he tries it.)
That drive to speak the truth typically evokes one of three responses in
parents: rebukes, apologetic murmurs, and stifled cackles. But when we are
intentional about cultivating this fearlessness in a way that balances
children’s innate bent toward justice with a strong sense of self, we can raise
natural leaders who ease into their personal brand of activism. The young
people in this chapter are proof that as Whitney—and Randy Watson—once
put it, “the children are our future.”
“I’m Not One of Your Little Friends” celebrates our children, spotlights
those who are fighting for their lives, and highlights the work of the
youngest activists among us.

## The Accidental Activist

In the fall of 2015, eighteen-year-old Niya Kenny shot video and spoke
up when a school resource officer threw one of her classmates across a
room, sparking the #AssaultAtSpringValleyHigh hashtag and amplifying
the national conversation about the school-to-prison pipeline. Kenny was
subsequently arrested and charged with “disturbing a school.” She decided
to leave Spring Valley High School and earn her GED: “I was ready to get
this entire high school experience over with,” she says. Now Kenny is
working with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to challenge the
South Carolina law that allowed her to be taken into custody and that sends
disproportionate numbers of students of color to jail each year. Here she
tells Kenrya about the day she became an activist.
What made you stand up for your classmate that day?
I can’t really say there was a thought that went through my head before I
stood up and started yelling. It was just my natural reaction.
Why do you think it wasn’t a natural reaction for the adults in
the room?
My guess is that maybe the adults felt they had to stick together in this
situation, whether it was right or wrong. I mean, the administrator who
came in before the officer, he was like, “I don’t got time to play with y’all
kids today.” Like, we already different from him in his head.
What was going through your head when school resource
officer Ben Fields put you in handcuffs after you stood up?
Honestly, My mama is gonna kill me. That was my biggest fear, because
I was my mom’s problem child. I would get into trouble with my teachers,
and I was just like, Dang, this is the first time that I never really did
anything, and I just need my mama to believe me! I was just so scared at
what she was going to think, and sad because I knew it would be
embarrassing for her to come get her child out of jail.
How did she react?
My little sister said that when she told my mom, her initial reaction was,
“I’m gonna kick her behind. I send y’all to school to learn, not to be getting
in people’s business.” Because the officer told my mom, “Oh, Niya got in
someone else’s business and now she’s being arrested.”
What a piece of shit. How did she react when she found out
what really happened?
She was very supportive, just letting me know that everything is going to
be okay. She wasn’t really telling me like, “Oh, we’re not gonna let him get
away with this,” but I could tell that was her attitude. “You’re not gonna put
my child in jail for no reason and then not suffer any kind of consequence.”
Her biggest thing was getting justice for me, because she felt like her child
had been done so wrong. That’s every parent’s nightmare.
How long were you in jail?
I was there for between eight and nine hours. That’s a full school day, in
a holding area with men.
What was your first thought when you got out?
Thank God I didn’t have to spend the night!
Why do you think Solicitor Dan Johnson ultimately dropped the
charge?
Honestly, I feel like there was no wrongdoing on my end, you know? He
had no choice but to drop those charges. This girl was assaulted, she was
taken to jail. Yelling and cursing in the classroom is disturbing school, I
won’t take that away, but the environment had already been disturbed before
I started protesting.
Why did you decide to challenge the constitutionality of South
Carolina’s disturbing school and disorderly conduct laws with
this ACLU lawsuit?
Because it’s regular kids whose lives are really affected by this law, and
it’s not fair. You can be arrested and taken to jail for anything that a teacher
considers disturbing their classroom, like chewing gum loudly, passing gas,
burping, whatever. This is a teacher, not a judge. Oh God, now I’m just
thinking about it all again. Those people made me so mad.
With good reason. What do you hope the outcome will be?
We want this disturbing schools law completely taken away. No child
should be charged with disturbing the school. Charging them with that is
basically just charging a child with being a child.
Did you think of yourself as an activist before October 26, 2015?
No. Never.
Did you think of yourself as an activist after that?
Yes, but not until I was told that I was one. I never knew how significant
it was until the video went viral. It was just me naturally reacting to what I
saw in front of me. This whole organizing world was introduced to me after
the incident. I didn’t even know about the organization I intern for, African
American Policy Forum. Kimberlé Crenshaw reached out and asked me to
come work for her. I didn’t even know what intersectionality was before
then.
What issues feel most important as you come into your activist
self?
I’m definitely still focused on the school-to-prison pipeline because I
have a personal experience with it. That’s always going to be an issue that I
care about the most, because I had to experience that myself.
Do you want to continue working in organizing?
I think I will do this work forever. But it won’t be the only thing that I
do, you know? I’m young. I want to experience everything that life has.
     I fight White supremacy by working with writers on the forefront of
    dismantling racist, sexist, homophobic, and classist ideology. Every
       book that envisions a truly integrated future while challenging
    narratives of oppression is a meaningful intervention with the power

## to change minds.

“The goal of White supremacy is to make people feel less than human,
to dehumanize us. As a photographer, I’m looking for the natural essence in
things, something that gives you a peek into the humanity of people. This
photo was part of a project called I Am Here: Girls Reclaiming Safe Spaces.
But what does it mean to create and reclaim a mental safe space? There are
some things that you have to be conscious of every day, or else you’ll get
sucked into this world of White supremacy and never see yourself. We have
to fight it, but if it takes up your whole life, then when are you supposed to
live? This photo shows the power in these young, living girls, which is the
power in us. They are living in their element, and they possess so much.
There is so much joy in who they are—in who we are.”—Delphine Adama

## Sidney Keys III Wants to Give the World a Book

     When Sidney Keys III’s mom, Winnie Caldwell, surprised him with a
visit to the St. Louis bookstore Eye See Me, he had no idea that it would
make him a digital star and an entrepreneur. Caldwell shot a video of her
then-ten-year-old son reading Danny Dollar Millionaire Extraordinaire by
Ty Allan Jackson, and it went viral, racking up more than sixty-five
thousand views. “We were like, ‘Maybe we can do something with this,’”
Keys says.
     That something was creating the Books N Bros club, which works to
increase literacy among boys ages seven to thirteen, with a focus on African
American–centered literature. “We started with this age group because boys
are specifically behind in reading, and seven to thirteen is the age range
where we typically stop picking up books,” Keys explains. “I don’t want
reading to be something you get made fun of for doing, or something that
scares boys.”
     It took just one month to organize the group’s first meet-up in September
2016, where seven boys came together at the bookstore to read and discuss
Danny Dollar. “I had my own lemonade stand there because in the book,
the boy made a million dollars from a lemonade stand,” Keys says. “We had
snacks and then we discussed the book in a little circle. It was a really cool
experience.”
Keys says he was drawn to the book because Danny Dollar reminded
him of someone he knew: himself. “I saw someone who looked like me.
Usually that only happens with nonfiction things, like books about Martin
Luther King,” he said. “Don’t get me wrong, those are good stories—but it’s
nice to see fiction, just regular stories, with people like you in them.”
Keys quickly expanded Books N Bros to include a subscription service.
Each month, subscribers get a book, a related worksheet, and a bookmark
that nets them free treats in exchange for reading. But Keys has even bigger
plans for Books N Bros: he wants to flex his entrepreneurial muscle and
create an after-school curriculum so that kids can hang out and read books
about Black protagonists.
           “Boo, Donald Trump” by Saa Rankin Naasel (2017)
Imagine walking into an art space and seeing a group of small brown
girls marching by, waving signs, pumping their fists, and chanting, “Donald
Trump, Donald Trump, has no friends! Donald Trump, Donald Trump,
smells like eggs!” That’s the sight that greeted visitors to an art camp in
Hyattsville, Maryland, where six-year-old Saa Rankin Naasel organized five
other girls—ages three to eight—for an anti-45 march. Struck by inspiration
after lunch on an afternoon in late December 2017, Rankin Naasel said she
organized the march “because Donald Trump is bad. He doesn’t like brown
people.” The pint-sized activist said that the way he treats people makes her
mad, but that marching made her feel happy because she was doing
something to push back against him.

## The Fight to Free Black Children

## Rickell Howard Smith

I am a civil rights attorney working to dismantle the school-to-prison
pipeline and eliminate the mass incarceration of Black children in America.
I represent children in civil rights cases and policy initiatives, focusing my
efforts on reducing racial disparities in education and the juvenile justice
system. I used to think my goal was to get favorable decisions in court, help
children avoid expulsion, and reduce racial profiling of Black children and
their subsequent contact with the system. But time, experience, and raising
two children of my own helped me realize the true purpose of my work: I
fight for Black children to be free.
Freedom is defined as possessing the power or right to act, speak, or
think as one wants without hindrance or restraint. But my vision for Black
children is more nuanced than that. They should be free to be children and
do childlike things without fear. They need the freedom to be bratty, sad,
confused, self-centered, and combative teenagers without fear that the
system will punish their age-appropriate behavior with lifelong or lifeending consequences. The freedom to live without being subjected to racebased trauma. The freedom to throw a temper tantrum without fear that the
cops will be called. The freedom to look at their phone in class without
concern that a law enforcement officer will body-slam them. The freedom to
play cops-and-robbers without being killed by one. The freedom to
experiment and find themselves without the suffocating intrusion of
institutional racism into their lives.
I became a mother during my second year of law school, and
motherhood has guided all of my personal and professional decisions since
the birth of my oldest child. For me, parenthood and civil rights advocacy
have a symbiotic relationship. I am, without a doubt, a better lawyer and a
better mother because I am both.
As a parent, I fight for my own freedom to teach my children that they
have dominion over their own bodies, the freedom to teach them that they
do not have to comply with a stranger’s order. However, my ability to teach
them how to be confident, strong-minded, and informed is restricted by the
exhaustive list of lessons that I have to teach them to ensure that they aren’t
seen as threats. I am fully aware that these lessons chip away at their ability
to be carefree, but I need them to make it home. I want to be free to raise
my children with the lessons and guidance necessary for them to realize
their full potential and be amazing people without fear.
Working in courtrooms has taught me that Black children are especially
vulnerable to becoming victims of injustice simply because of who they are.
They are simultaneously subjected to age-based prejudice and systemic
racism. The American legal system does not afford the same constitutional
rights to children as adults. They are taught to respect and comply with
authority figures at home, in the community, and at school, to be seen and
not heard. The system is designed to stifle and silence them. On top of this,
Black children experience the same barriers to freedom as Black adults.
They often feel powerless to self-advocate because their spirits are
suppressed by systemic racism, and they lack the legal protections and
opportunities to advocate for themselves.
Case in point: Even though the American juvenile justice system has
been undergoing systemic reform for nearly twenty years, Black children
have barely benefited from those efforts. National youth incarceration rates
have dropped significantly over the last decade, but racial disparity in the
juvenile justice system continues to grow as Black children are victimized
by systemic racism. They face harsher school discipline consequences, at
higher rates, and they are more likely to be arrested, charged, and punished
severely for engaging in the same age-appropriate behavior as their White
counterparts.
Of course, this is no secret to Black folks. We don’t need data reports to
tell us what’s happening in our own communities. But being entrenched in
this work reminds me that no matter how well they were raised, or how
wealthy or educated their parents are, our precious kids are not immune
from this. This understanding shapes the way I advocate for all Black
children and raise my own. Rearing children as a civil rights advocate
makes me view everything through a dual lens. As an advocate: how do I
use the outcome of this court case to help Black children be free? As a
mama: how will this make things better for my babies?
I once thought that being a Black woman civil rights attorney was the
height of my personal revolutionary action. Now I know that parenting my
children is the most revolutionary thing that I can do in this world.
Parenthood transformed me from a lawyer to a freedom fighter for Black
children. They need all of us more now than ever. They need our collective
love and support. They need us to see them as children. They need the
change agents in the world to focus on their voices, needs, and desires. They
need us to create space and opportunity for them to advocate for themselves.
They need us to tear down the suffocating force of systemic racism so that
they can be free. So they can live.
Rickell Howard Smith is the litigation and policy director at a nonprofit child
advocacy organization. She specializes in civil rights litigation aimed at reforming
the criminal and juvenile justice systems and was a 2017 Youth Justice Leadership
Institute Fellow of the National Juvenile Justice Network.
     I fight White supremacy by teaching my children about Black power,
          excellence, and magic. The same way that White supremacy is a
    learned behavior, our children need to learn that their ancestors were
    great leaders and innovators whose contributions impact the world in

## a major way.

Author and Journalist Denene Millner on Why She Has
Dedicated Her Career to Making Books for Black Children
When I got pregnant with my first baby, I promised that my child
wouldn’t have to spend the most impressionable part of her life longing for
herself in literature. The books I publish through Denene Millner Books all
celebrate Black children. What I love about these books—including Crown:
An Ode to the Fresh Cut, There’s a Dragon in My Closet, and Early Sunday
Morning—is that they shine a light on our babies and their everyday lives.
There’s no focus on civil rights icons. No big-ups for famous jazz singers or
sports figures. No nods to slavery. There’s no overcoming or struggling to
get by, or Black “firsts” we force children to revere. They are just good oldfashioned tales about the lives of little human beings with brown skin—my
love letter to children of color who deserve to see their beauty and humanity
in the most remarkable form of entertainment on the planet: books.

## QUESTION, ANSWERED

    Much of who we are starts when we are tiny humans. So we explored the
question: what’s your activism origin story?

## Kenrya

    A play in four acts.

## Act I

    It’s 1989 at Aurora Road Elementary School in Bedford Heights, Ohio.
I’m in the third grade, and I am decidedly my father’s child. He had settled
into paycheck-to-paycheck-class life in a suburb across town from my
cousins where we could get a good public school education and still see
Black people, but before I was born, he was a beret-wearing, rifle-toting,
school breakfast program–starting Black nationalist. And though his strong
moral compass meant that he left that organization when internal corruption
surfaced, he never stepped away from his love for his people and contempt
for the system that brutalized us. Accordingly, he was very honest about
what it meant for my sister and me as Black children growing up in a nation
that has, from the very beginning, treated us as less than human. So after I
learned from him while I was still in single digits that this supposedly
“indivisible” country was fueled by disregard for our lives and that the
actual words of the Pledge of Allegiance were drafted with xenophobia and
White supremacy in mind, I decided that I was not pledging my allegiance
to shit, thanks. Every morning the entire school says the pledge as someone
recites it over the intercom system. Every morning I stand, hands at my
sides, mouth closed. No one says a word to me about it.

## Act II

    It’s seven years later, and I join the NAACP because my friends are in
the youth chapter and it looks fun. We hold a ton of voter registration drives
at skating rinks and parks, but the first time I feel like an actual activist is
during a national convention. That’s when I participate in my first sit-in.
The details are hazy—I’m old, y’all—but the national board is planning to
reduce funding for youth field coordinators, the folks who provide training
and support for local youth chapters like mine. Being a kid in this eldersdominated space feels like engaging in a never-ending game of Mother May
I? The organization is granted giant steps forward for publicly holding up
young people as the next front in the movement. But when it withholds the
support we need to actually lead, it feels like we’re bounding backward
when no one is looking. So we use the tactics of those who came before us
and hit the floor outside the boardroom, vowing to stay there until they
make it rain. I go on to hold leadership positions with my college NAACP
chapter.

## Act III

    The summer after my freshman year at Howard, I spend my afternoons
interning at an advertising firm in Cleveland where I am, of course, the only
Black person in the entire office. One Friday, my supervisor, a young White
woman, gives me a task. “Can you please take this box of client contacts
and put it in alphabetical order?” I cheerfully accept the box of maybe one
hundred notecards, sit at my desk, and proceed to put them in order in a few
minutes. When I arrive back at her cubicle with the cards, she looks
confused. “Do you have a question?” she asks. “No. I’m done,” I say,
handing her the box. “Done?! How?” she asks, still puzzled. “It was
alphabetical order,” I say, eyebrow raised, also puzzled. “Wow! You’re
amazing! Thanks so much for doing this so quickly!” she says. I squint at
her, then walk back to my desk, wounded, but not really understanding why.
The soft bigotry of low expectations is some insidious shit.

## Act IV

     It’s 2014 and I’m somebody’s mama. Police shootings of unarmed Black
men and boys like Eric Garner and Michael Brown are forcing us to beg the
world to assign value to our lives, and the National Action Network holds
the Justice for All march in Washington, DC. I hit the ground with a couple
of my linesisters and our kids and try not to cry as they march—literally,
because my three-year-old isn’t fucking with you if you’re not high-stepping
it through the streets—holding handmade signs that read, OUR LIVES
MATTER. I tell an interviewer that day: “I wanted her to know, even at her
young age, that we are our most powerful when we are united. I wanted her
to see what it looks like when thousands of people come together to
advocate for themselves. I wanted her to feel the energy that is generated
when people have had enough and decide to do something about it. So we
took to the streets.”

## Akiba

     I did a decent amount of community service growing up. I participated
in walkathons, collated stuff for my mother’s meetings, served as a peer
educator at Planned Parenthood, and took part in an “Africentric”
curriculum effort called African Youth for Education. On the get-shine side,
I sang the Negro National Anthem at an anti–Desert Storm rally. And
because I was “conscious,” I was also quoted in the newspaper, once for
citing the fatal flaws of an all-White newsroom and once for pointing out
that “a dangerous psyche of materialism” explained why a Black girl had
been shot over a pair of gold earrings.
     Still, it wasn’t until my senior year of high school that I attempted to
organize people to fight White supremacy.
     The public school my sister and I attended was considered the best in the
city and one of the top in the state of Pennsylvania. Coming out of a
predominantly White, single-sex prep school, this elite public school I will
call Super Selective College Preparatory Magnet Academy (SSCPMA) had
many appealing features: boys, boys who were Black, and a bevy of Latinx,
Asian, and South Asian kids.
But in this public school, where I desperately wanted to fit in, I was
incensed by the racism of some of the teachers.
First, there was a phrase I only saw Black kids being disciplined with:
“This is not your neighborhood school! This is SSCPMA!” Within this
context, “neighborhood school” was coded language for an inferior “ghetto”
institution that accepted just any old person. The trope suggested that Black
students should go back to their natural habitat—a school with low
standards.
In another case, an elderly White teacher who I was told had tenure
would routinely make blatantly ignorant mistakes about Black history. No,
sir. Malcolm X was not murdered in 1950. And slavery didn’t end after a
“few decades.” When I tried to clarify, he would kick me out of class.
Another teacher, we heard, was overtly racist. He once told a Black
student eating an apple that she should be eating a banana instead. Another
time he told a Black girl wearing a headwrap that she looked like Aunt
Jemima.
My headwrap-wearing, conscious Afrikan crew had been commiserating
about the subtle racism of the school, but the Aunt Jemima comment
compelled us to do something.
I truly don’t remember whose idea it was to distribute daily anonymous
flyers demanding that racist teachers be fired or at least forced to undergo
diversity training. I also can’t recall whose idea it was to tell students to
wear black armbands in solidarity with our movement and come to a
speakout we’d be holding at the end of the week.
I do remember writing the text for our missives, which I photocopied on
hundreds of pieces of colored paper at my mother’s job. Each installment
included a subversive quote that could be read as empowering, vaguely
threatening, or a declaration of race war, depending on your vantage point.
Apparently White students into neo-Nazi punk culture took our movement
as a war cry—we heard they were planning to bring knives to our speakout.
After we promoted it with a week’s worth of flyers secretly dropped in
various locations throughout the school, the speakout was lit!
      As planned, we in the vanguard of the movement sanctioned our racist
teachers and called for them to be fired or retrained. But somehow the
discussion drifted to interpersonal racism among students. (This is my adult
retelling. I didn’t know the phrase “interpersonal racism” until I was like
forty.) One of the Nazi girls started an impassioned speech about how
scared she was about what “you people are doing here.”
      “You people? ” we vanguards hissed.
      “Let her explain!” said unaffiliated centrists of color in the room. The
girl got to make her point about how “we” wouldn’t get anywhere if we
focused on race so much. People clapped. I felt sick, then checked out.
      After our speakout ended, I found myself enveloped in the arms of a
non-vanguard brother who had helped us set up the chairs. “We did it!” he
said joyously.
      “We did not do it at all,” I said. “We let that racist White girl disrespect
us.”
      He looked at me strangely and said, “You’re never satisfied.”
      A few days later, it got back to me that at least two girls in our little
Afrikan organizing crew were calling me full of shit and saying that I only
“did this to get famous.” I was so crushed by their betrayal that I got sick
with flulike symptoms.
      I was out of school with the flu and what was very likely a bout of
depression so long that I missed the school gospel choir’s big performance
at the Gallery Mall downtown. I was a soloist and had been plotting for
weeks how I would impress this college-age gentleman who designed and
sold conscious Black T-shirts at the mall. Not only had organizing made me
sick, but it ruined my (imagined) chance with T-shirt jawn.
      Months later, the four White Los Angeles police officers caught on video
camera savagely beating Black motorist Rodney King—Stacey Koon,
Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, and Theodore Briseno—were found
innocent. It was an early ’90s precursor to today, when ubiquitous cellphone and police video footage of officers beating, Tasing, choking, setting
up, sexually assaulting, and fatally shooting Black people ensures the
trauma of both victims and viewers—and too often leaves the apathetic
justice system unmoved.
As Los Angeles burned, students of all races held a walkout. School
authorities accused me of orchestrating the protest, but it certainly wasn’t
me. It was, however, the moment when vanguard and oblivious alike agreed
that there was something very, very wrong with America.

## FIVE

## GOD IS GOOD, ALL THE TIME…

When she was five, a kid we know and adore discovered Siri. Every morning she pressed the home button on her iPad and kicked off the day’s
conversation, which usually revolved around one of two things: jokes and
questions about Jesus. For the record, Siri is too bougie for the former and
clueless about the latter, bringing up random Wikipedia pages with Jesus’s
name sprinkled across them like she’s really doing something. The kid’s
perennial favorite Siri question was, “What is Jesus’s favorite color?” but
she saved the tough religion questions for her mama.
On the way to school on 45’s inauguration day, she asked the question
that troubled the minds of many: “But he doesn’t like people who look like

## us. Why did Jesus let him win?”

Yeah.
It’s heartbreaking that kindergarteners are already contemplating why
bad things happen to good people, but for people of faith, this illuminates
the often-complicated relationship between religion and justice. We all have
an auntie who consistently answers the question “How are you?” with
“Blessed,” and says the Black Lives Matter activists need to pull up their
pants and get out of the street. And her leather-bound Bible is full of verses
that excuse earthly injustice and encourage the oppressed to pray for the
souls of their oppressors.
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek,
turn to them the other cheek also.… You have heard that it was said, “Love your
neighbor and hate your enemy.” But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those
who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes
his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the
unrighteous. (Matthew 5:39, 43–45, New International Version)
But religion has also formed the core of righteous movements and works
of art, from Phillis Wheatley’s poem “To the Right Honourable William,
Earl of Dartmouth,” to the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, to the advancement of the Woke Vote movement. And there are
people organizing right now around the idea that faith—combined with
good works—is strong enough to push away those who seek to use the word
of God to oppress a people.
From the pastor who challenges the prevailing characterization of Christ
to a witch who celebrates the divine in us all to the Islam convert who revels
in the ways Black Muslims around the world unite, this chapter explores
how a connection to the spirit can be a catalyst for change—especially
among those who have been disabused of the notion that they have to wait
until the afterlife to be free.

## Black Grace Is Not Cheap

## Darnell L. Moore

On the morning of August 31, 2014, the pews at St. John’s United
Church of Christ in northern St. Louis were full. It was the final day of the
Black Lives Matter Freedom Ride to Ferguson. At the beginning of that
Labor Day weekend, nearly five hundred contemporary freedom riders from
across the United States and Canada had arrived to provide support to local
organizers. Our presence in the church that morning was a sign of our
collective resistance, not a reverent, forbearing acquiescence to extrajudicial
killing. Black grace, after all, is not cheap.
The streets of Ferguson were still hot when we arrived. The rage of the
local Black activists swelled because one of Ferguson’s young, eighteenyear-old Michael Brown Jr., had been fatally shot by White police officer
Darren Wilson.
Justice seemed to be an illusion, but local organizers and their allies
were determined that there would be no peace in the absence of perceptible,
material amends in response to Brown’s killing. During one of a few
marches held that weekend, it seemed that many of the people in attendance
had dispensed with grace. Some of the younger marchers were rightfully
angry because not only had their neighbor been killed by a police officer,
but his bloodied body had been left in the street on public display under the
heat of the summer sun for four hours. They were less interested in offering
solemn prayers calling for peace. They wanted Wilson’s job. They
demanded an end to the abuse and killing of Black people by law
enforcement. They were prepared to disrupt a local law enforcement unit
whose bloated financial coffers were full because of unjustified and biased
fees imposed upon Ferguson’s mostly Black population.
But offerings of Black grace, without any hint of justice, are exactly
what some church leaders have preached. Biblical scriptures like Ephesians
6:5—“Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the
flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ”—
have been rendered as the calculus for Black servility, and the authoritative
proof that enslaved Africans’ submission to White slave masters was akin to
them submitting to Christ. But these are different, and not so different,
times.
Throughout the history of the United States, Black people have been
expected to forgive. We have been asked to extend charity in advance of the
“freedom dreams” so many Christian leaders preach as manifested realities
to be experienced in heaven only. Forget the police shootings and the
officers who kill Black people with impunity. Forget the incessant
conditions of overpolicing, surveillance, and incarceration in Black
communities—whether rural, urban, or suburban. Forget the economic
policies and voting systems that continue to disenfranchise Black people.
Forget housing markets established to diminish Black ownership and
economic well-being, the urban renewal plans created to keep Black people
locked within ghettoized zones and gentrification and educational inequity.
Forget White racists marching under the banner of Confederate flags on
Southern streets and a sitting White racist president who called Black
nations “shithole” countries while refusing to call White nationalists racists.
In some ways, the “when we all get to heaven” understanding of justice
makes sense. Black preachers’ insistence that we will someday ascend to a
far-off plane beyond our present world that’s free of anti-Black racism,
economic disparity, and social death is a commentary on the state of our
present realities. It’s their way of saying, “Shit ain’t right in our here and
now.” Yet any theology that is disconnected from the material evils
impaling Black bodies, Black communities, Black life, is not indicative of
liberation at all.
The message we received during that weekend in St. John’s was
different. What was preached was not the typical word offered during
Sunday morning services for Black Christians, who are often imagined as
too benign or caricatured as people befuddled by a colonizer’s theology.
Rev. Starsky Wilson preached a sermon titled “The Politics of Jesus.” He
did not sermonize a White Jesus, the Christ with blue eyes and blond hair
deemed divine in Renaissance paintings and the racist imagination. There
was no preaching of a gospel that demands that the downtrodden, Black
people included, throw up weary hands and resign themselves to the
torment meted out by individual actors and anti-Black institutions who do
them harm. His sermon was peppered with words like “radical” and
“revolutionary,” not “moderation” and “restrained.”
The state, in Wilson’s estimation, should be the target of Ferguson
organizers’ critique. Whether the cross, the lynching tree, the bullet from a
police officer’s gun, or the unjust judgment of a court, the Black body, like
Christ’s tortured frame, figures almost always as an enfleshed target at
which the state and White racist vigilantes (and sometimes they are one and
the same) aim their weapons. And as the congregation of the affected leapt
from seats, swayed arms in the air, and cried out affirmations, it was clear to
me that the spiritual pulse of this particular iteration of a long-standing
movement for Black lives, like freedom struggles of the past, would be one
electrified by a fierce rejection of the status quo, not tamped down into
submission.
The movement for Black lives has presented contemporary Black
churches and professed Christians with a necessary task, namely, a push to
reconsider the contexts of a faith system steeped in patriarchy, sexism,
militarism, xenophobia, rape culture, homophobia, Zionism, and antiBlackness. Black people have critiqued dogmatic, anti-Black Christian
theologies that have been used to douse Black rage in the past. But now it is
time to consider the ways in which some churches have perpetuated
perverted ideas of grace—the type of twisted, unmerited favor granted by
some Black Christians who prefer praising Jesus alongside racist rape
apologists like Donald Trump and Mike Pence while condemning and
disposing of other Black people.
In the past, too many of the organizers had been told by some Black
Christian leader that Black feminism, transness, and queerness, our
liberated gender expressions, our unconventional Black politics, our roots in
African traditional religions, our disbelief in deities, our lack of faith in the
state, the ways we love, the ways we fuck, the ways we resist, are all
counter-Christian. Some leaders have even preached that “hell” would be
the lot of many of the Black activists in that sanctuary because of their
beliefs, political views, or ways of being.
The Black people assembled in St. John’s that Labor Day weekend
showed up because of their profound love for Black people. The sermon,
which was emblematic of the politics of the people, insisted that we must
fight for liberation for all Black people—even those who have preached
words of hate condemning us. The appeal to resist the lure of Black
disposability was, to me, Black grace as practice.
Black people must never do to each other what the system does to us,
and we must never acquiesce to the iniquity, the evil, the collective sin, that
is White supremacy. Black grace is expensive. And its cost is the end of the
violences that do us harm. Its consequences are transformative justice and a
remaking of the world as we know it. And it won’t be granted for White
tears. Or White guilt. Or White self-invested liberalism. But for Black
freedom.

## What Matters Is What Is True

## Haylin Belay

You are a being of immense power. So am I.
“Magic” and “witchcraft” are umbrella terms used to describe a diverse
collection of religions, belief systems, spiritual practices, and superstitions.
Some of these systems, like santeria and voodoo, are culturally bound,
developed by specific groups. Others, like wicca, cobble together existing
practices from various disciplines, philosophies, and ideologies and codify
them into a single dogma. Some forms of witchcraft involve god, goddess,
or saint worship; some are highly structured, with clear hierarchies of
power; some are both of these things; and some are neither. My witchcraft is
solitary, nondogmatic, nontheistic, and highly eclectic. But it is only one of
many ways to be a witch.
There is one unifying thread that ties all of these beliefs and practices to
magic. Imagine that there is a universal energy outside of our current
scientific apprehension that helps to shape our world. You can envision that
energy as a named deity or group of deities, as color, as light, as feeling; I
personally see it as the divine. When we brush up against this energy, we
often describe it as fate, synchronicity, or “the universe.”
To believe in magic is to believe that in our mundane world—where the
things we can see, feel, measure, and touch reside—the divine is everpresent, explaining the inexplicable. Most importantly, the divine is present
in individuals. To believe in witchcraft is to believe that, with intention, we
can intuitively access our personal divinity and harness that energy to enact
change in the world on both the energetic and mundane levels. In this
imagination, in this belief, you are a being of immense power, and so am I.
Whether I’m on a first date, chatting with coworkers, or mingling at a
cocktail party, people invariably ask the same question when I describe
myself as a witch: “Do you think it’s real ?” To which I reply: “It doesn’t
matter if it’s real, it matters that it’s true.”
And it is. Witchcraft is one of the most true things that I have found—
not only as a spiritual practice but as a political one, a reclamation of my
personal power as a woman, a Black person, a Black woman.
There is a mundane argument for the “reality” of witchcraft. The
antimicrobial, antibacterial, and adaptogenic properties of basil are well
documented by science, for example, and the reality that many cultures
worldwide have used basil as an herb of protection and healing suggests that
the medicine and magic of our herbalist ancestors had some basis in
“scientific fact.” Similarly, research on mindfulness seems to support the
idea that mantra, meditation, and prayer—intentional thought—can have a
profound effect on our emotional, mental, and physical well-being.
But the, well, magic of magic is that it does not need to be rationally
explained to be true. The “validation” of herbalist and spiritual practices of
centuries past means little to its historical and present-day practitioners.
Much in the same way, sociological and psychological studies
“documenting” the weathering effects of racist microaggressions, or
“revealing” the challenges that Black bodies face, mean very little to Black
people, who know and feel these things to be true. A woman who has been
abused by men does not need incontrovertible proof of a man’s character to
recognize the way she feels in her body when she is around a man who is
untrustworthy. This is what we call intuition: when we do not need
something external to prove to us what we know to be true.
Whether or not you consider yourself magical, or a witch, or even
esoterically inclined, you have intuition. It is the gut sense that tells us
truths our conscious mind alone cannot explain. These feelings also have a
basis in scientific fact, in the cranial nerves and autonomic nervous system,
but you do not need me or anyone else to explain to you that it is true. You
are a being of immense power, and so am I.
I had been doing magic for a long time before I ever called myself a
witch. Not just doing it—I was steeped in it, though no one ever called it
that. When I was a child, my nineteen-year-old mother took me to an
Eastern Orthodox Church whose practice approximated the tradition she
was raised in back home in Ethiopia, the most ancient Christian empire. In
that church, shrouded in thick incense and golden ornaments, I learned
about God, sin, and ritual. God and sin never followed me home—those
concepts lived in the church, where sermons about harlots and the evil of
single motherhood eventually drove us out. But ritual was everywhere
around me, like the very air I breathed, or the water of the womb.
Ritual was the way my mother walked around the house roasting coffee
beans, allowing guests to waft the smoke into their faces, to cleanse their
bodies with the rich and comforting smell. Ritual was the way my mother
laid her hands on my belly, or my head, wherever it hurt, to “take the
sickness out” of me. Her hands were a better remedy than any pill or
ointment. They held the power of intention and the power of my mother—
the greatest power my child’s mind could imagine.
One of the most important sites of ritual in my young life was the
kitchen. It was there that my mother poured homemade kibbe and love into
clay pots and served up a platter of injera and wot for the household to
share, always eating it with our right hands. It was where we fed each other
gursha, the Amharic word for the heaping handful of food that friends,
family members, and loved ones feed each other, hand to mouth, as a sign of
love, respect, and devotion. Feeding someone, nourishing their body, is the
purest and simplest act of love.
For most of my life, my mother was a God-fearing woman who would
have collapsed to her knees in prayer if she ever heard her daughter say she
was practicing magic. Now she holds her love for God and her clairvoyant
visions in the same body, without apology, because she knows her intuition
is of God and from God. Much as I bought my first Tarot deck in the
aftermath of an abusive relationship, seeking a way to rebuild my sense of
self and worth, my mother’s transformation happened after she was released
from a marriage that robbed her of agency. In her rejection of that
oppression, she embraced the personhood that she had been denied for
decades.
So it is not surprising to me that our paths wound in the same direction;
in fact, my mother is the one who taught me magic. After all, what is magic
if not the way that a kiss on the forehead becomes a seal of protection?
What is magic if not the way that food from my own hand tastes different
from the food my mother placed lovingly into my mouth? These physical
motions took on special significance because of their intention, because
when a human being acts in the mundane realm, their intention ripples
through the energetic world. That ripple is magic.
For me, claiming the name of “witch” is an active reclamation of the
ways of knowing and being that were denied to me by White supremacy, by
patriarchy, by capitalism, by abuse on institutional, interpersonal,
internalized, and ideological levels. To call myself a witch is to call myself a
being of power, to honor the ways in which I know things and my capacity
to effect change in my world. My practice brings me closer to the intuition
that systems of oppression have sought to beat out of me. It helps me to heal
my own personal trauma, my familial trauma, the intergenerational trauma
and mass-scale gaslighting that fights daily to splinter my spirit and the
spirits of people who look like me.
On a functional level, it helps me get through my day. Ritualizing my
own self-care (cleaning becomes a ritual of cleansing and protection,
bathing becomes a spell for calling in self-love and acceptance) helps me
maintain my physical body—the body I have been told, implicitly and
explicitly, is only useful for giving pleasure and receiving degradation from
others. When I imagine my body as a vessel for my divinity, my humanness,
I reclaim myself. They tell me Black bodies are worthless; I tell them this
Black body is sacred.
On a spiritual level, it helps me heal and find purpose. Centering my
own intuition, my own pleasure, my own boundaries, as not only parts of
myself but parts of myself that are undeniably divine shows me a path
forward when the path behind me is littered with reasons I am wrong and do
not matter. Every time I come to my altar space and craft spells with
intention, I remind myself that I am a being of divinity, a divinity beyond
apprehension, and that no one and no thing can take that from me. What
they say about me, about us, isn’t true. This is true.
I am a being of immense power. So are you.

Pastor Michael McBride on the European Bastardization of
Jesus and Why We All Need to Stop Aspiring to Whiteness If We

## Are to Be Free

As the lead pastor at The Way Christian Center in Berkeley, California,
and the director of PICO National Network’s Live Free Campaign to end
mass criminalization and gun violence, Pastor Michael McBride spends his
days attacking White supremacy from the pulpit and on the streets. He was
on the front lines in Ferguson following the death of Michael Brown;
cofounded New Nation Rising, which operates a political action committee
that supports the strategic engagement of young Black religious voters
across the country; and helped create the Woke Vote program, which
mobilized Black folks in Alabama to save the state from an alleged sexual
predator.
In this talk with Kenrya, Pastor Mike, as he’s known, shares the
conversation that forever changed his practice, the ways the American
empire hijacks the Jesus he serves, and why the world needs to stop
reaching for Whiteness if we all are to be free.
In one sentence, what do you do?
I organize faith leaders and people of faith to dismantle White
supremacy and structural racism through the power of representing voices
and practices.
What’s your origin story as a pastor?
Well, our family is four generations of Holiness Pentecostal Christians,
and we have a deep tradition of ministry in our family. When I was born,
there were certain words of prophecy—or at least encouragement—that I
would continue in that projection of ministry. I was called into the ministry
at the age of sixteen, licensed around twenty-one or twenty-two, had my
master’s of divinity at the age of twenty-nine, and started pastoring at the
age of thirty. My ministry vision was honed and shaped out of an
experience of injustice and violence, at the hand of the police, and certainly
pastoral care, engaging with congregation members and communities that
were experiencing perpetual violence at the hands of the state. All of those
things informed my ministry call. My theological formation at Duke helped
to create a “theo-practice”—both theology and practices that are liberatory.
It helps to inform much of the work that we do.
Now tell me your story as a racial justice organizer. It sounds as
if they overlap.
I would say that my racial justice lens, and tipping point, came when I
was a youth pastor in 1999. I was physically and sexually assaulted by two
White police officers while I was in Bible college. That experience
crystallized the need for my ministry to be about more than just saving
souls. I was moved by my own abuse at the hands of the police, but also by
the testimonies of the young people in my congregation who told me that it
happened to them all the time. And when I asked why they had never
mentioned it to me, they said they didn’t believe that this part of their lives
was something to bring into the church.
That conversation was just as disjointing as my experience with the
police, as I realized that my young people could trust me with their souls,
but they couldn’t trust me with their bodies. It really forced me to have a
totally different orientation as to my responsibility as both a survivor of
police violence and a minister. That catalyzed me to enroll in Duke Divinity
School, and it introduced me to a number of powerful mentors and
theologians who had a history of Black resistance and theological reflection
that continues to inform the way I imagine ministry.
Why do you think they didn’t feel that church was a place to
bring their concerns?
They didn’t see us actively addressing it from the pulpit. Most of our
conversations were around personal responsibility. We had about a hundred
young people showing up regularly, so it wasn’t as if the space wasn’t
welcoming for them. But we sent both implicit and explicit messages that
what happened outside the church was not something that we put a priority
on addressing. What we were really trying to address was their personal,
moral formation—maybe building resilience for whatever came their way.
But the idea that we would try to change the actual realities of their day-today lives—much less the systems that guide them—I would say, in
hindsight, was totally absent from my ministry practice and vision. They
obviously understood that, and it forced us to think differently about who
had power and what that power could be used to accomplish.
I once heard you paraphrase Black theologian James Cone as
saying, “Too often, American Christianity has become
comfortable being a chaplain to White supremacy.” What does
that mean to you?
     The United States has figured out a way to bend a false interpretation of
Christianity to undergird, and make sense of, a logic of White supremacy
and racial hierarchy. It means that they turned Jesus of scripture into a
champion of empire. The Jesus who was actually murdered by the state,
they turned that Jesus into a war hero who wants to lead imperialistic
projects all across the globe. I think Cone rightly named White supremacy
as a project of the American Empire, which requires religious
underpinnings to help it make moral and political sense. Too often the
church has allowed itself to be seduced by that project. The Black church
serves as a departure from that.
     Now, of course, the Black church is imperfect. We still have so much
growing and learning to do around issues of misogyny and gender, around
justice and LGBTQ issues, and making sure we’re resisting and critiquing
capitalism and racial hierarchy. But I think it’s an enduring institution that
deserves the continued investment of Black people because it continues to
be a life-giving place. I hope that’s our biggest legacy: reintroducing a vital
institution for Black people to continue to draw moral, spiritual, political,
and cultural power from.
What’s the biggest misconception that people have about the
Jesus that you serve?
     The Jesus I serve is a dark-skinned Palestinian Jew who was born to an
unwed teenage mother in the ’hood of His day called Nazareth. He was
unjustly arrested, racially profiled, and convicted for crimes that He did not
commit, and was killed by the Roman Empire of His day. That Jesus is a
Jesus who sides with the poor and dispossessed; that Jesus is a liberator of
the soul and the body; that Jesus is never siding with the rich, the powerful,
the elite; that Jesus offers salvation to all who would renounce the ways of
oppressive death and dominion. The Jesus that I serve says, “I’ve come to
disrupt, I’ve come to confront.” The Jesus that I serve is one who is not
silent in the face of oppression. That Jesus is very self-sacrificial and puts
Himself in harm’s way, and that Jesus is a victor—He overcomes evil.
How does reaching for Whiteness impact the fight against White
supremacy?
Whiteness is a constructed identity in the United States. As people show
up to the United States, they have to forgo a certain kind of historical and
cultural point of value and try to fit into a destination that leads nowhere.
Whiteness, then, robs everyone of their ability to actually be their full
person and their full humanity. Because if you’re not White, male, wealthy,
and Christian, then you’re consistently reaching for something you can
never become.
I believe that this is the greatest task for faith leaders in this season: to
help individuals stop reaching for Whiteness. Even White people have to
stop reaching for Whiteness. Because there are a lot of folks who identify as
White now who, in this country’s history, used to not be considered White.
It’s a creation that we all have to resist. Only then can we effectively address
the systems that oppress us all.
So when we’re not resisting, we need to be building, right?
What does that freedom look like in your eyes?
I go to images that come out of my faith. The garden is a fascinating
frame that is used in scripture. It’s a place where there’s abundance; a place
where there is life; a place where there are notes of tranquility, peace, and
interdependence; a place where you feel safe. To me, liberation is about
human flourishing. It is about creating systems that do not limit the ability
of human beings to flourish, to reach their highest potential. It is not overly
punitive. It takes into account that to be human is to also be one who makes
mistakes, that to be perfect should not be the prerequisite to experience life.
We need systems and modalities and processes for redemption, for second
chances. Liberation is where a difference is seen as an asset and not a
liability. We need an economic system that is not exploitative. One that is
almost utilitarian in a sense that economics are a means to create a common
good—not a tool to drive exploitation or hierarchy.

“This work was an exercise in loosening up and drawing from impulse. I
thought about what images I tend to shy away from and why, then I
confronted that with drawing. I think a depiction of a Black body existing
easefully and comfortably is resistance.”—Xia Gordon

## The Pilgrimage

## Margari Aziza Hill

We were a spectacle in the Old City of Fez, Morocco: my White
classmates, our white-haired professor, and me, a Black woman, straggling
behind as we moved through the ancient streets. Someone shouted, “Belek!
Watch out!” and we moved in time to avoid being knocked over by a
delivery man barreling through with his cart. Another “Belek! ” and we
dodged a mule loaded with goods. Bustling residents coagulated at shops
and haggled over goods, while others squeezed by, hurrying to their
destinations. My classmates’ Whiteness drew attention. The children
playfully announced our group to shopkeepers ahead, shouting, “AlAmerikiyeen! ” My brown skin and long frizzy hair contrasted with that of
my classmates, and a Moroccan child ran up to me and asked, “AntiMaghribiyyah? Are you Moroccan?” No, I wasn’t Moroccan. And unlike
much of the Moroccan population, I didn’t grow up as a Muslim. My path
to Fez, to learning, and Islam, was intertwined with my struggle to resist
White supremacy.
As a teen, like a typical Black hipster from San Jose, I made regular
pilgrimages to Oakland. After graduating high school in 1993, I took a trip
to the Lakeshore district, where I read two books that changed my life’s
course.
The first was Chancellor Williams’s The Destruction of African
Civilization. Williams was notedly anti-Muslim in tone, calling the AfroBerber Almoravid tribes “fanatic” and “semi-barbarous,” but his
contradictions piqued my interest. The Almoravids established an empire
that stretched from Mauritania to Andalusia, and African rulers embraced
Islam and tapped into trans-Saharan trade routes. That same day I read
Clayborn Carson’s Malcolm X: The FBI File, in which agents and
informants tracked the leader’s journey from prison to Africa and the
Middle East, where he visited heads of state.
I began wondering what it was about Islam that transformed Malcolm
and led him on a journey to transnational liberation. And what roles did
trade and Islamic learning play in connecting the three precolonial West
African empires: Ghana beginning in the eighth century, thirteenth-century
Mali, and the Songhai from the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries?
What did the world look like outside of a system of White supremacy?
I embraced Islam that fall as an act of self-definition and rejection of my
internalized racism. Believing in an omnipotent god without human form
short-circuited the White god I’d been taught to worship.
Ten years later, I finally graduated from Santa Clara University. In the
admissions essays I crafted when I applied to nine graduate programs to
study the history of Islam, I wrote about my personal struggles to finish
school, as well as my informal and traditional Islamic learning. On
Valentine’s Day 2004, the director of Stanford University’s history
department called with news of my acceptance. In preparation for graduate
work, I enrolled in a six-week summer program to study Arabic and learn
about Morocco. It was my first trip abroad, one that opened up a world
beyond books, rhetoric, and semantics.
My experience in Fez gave me a new context to explore being a Black
woman of faith—it forms the core of my resistance. Through ritual,
communal worship, and movement, my ziyara, or pilgrimage, marked a
connectedness that shapes all I do. My acts of worship have everything to
do with fighting White supremacy, and I am still exploring issues around
resistance, faith, racial oppression, and community formation fifteen years
later. The oppressed in every Muslim society struggle for liberation through
religious interpretation and the creation of new ways of being in
community. That includes women like me.
While addressing inequality in Muslim-majority societies, the
marginalized among us draw on Islam’s antiracism ethos to critique power. I
resist by believing, learning, creating, and connecting with others to be free
within our communities and in society at large. Working in antiracism
education allows me to name the system that seeks to alienate me from my
Black female body, my sense of connectedness, and my yearning for
transcendence.
Black Muslims in the United States resist anti-Muslim policies and
narratives, while addressing anti-Black racism from within and outside our
faith community. In the years following 9/11, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation developed a network of more than fifteen thousand informants,
many of whom were tasked with infiltrating an estimated twenty-five
## *
hundred mosques. Meanwhile, the NYPD mapped out twenty-eight
“ancestries of interest” that were all linked to Muslim-majority societies and
## *
included “American Black Muslims.” Law enforcement detained my
husband for the innocuous act of taking a picture of a train for an art class;
the FBI interviewed him at work. We are deeply aware of profiling from the
Transportation Security Administration when we travel, we are subject to
no-fly lists, and we were even prevented from entering the country under the
Muslim ban. Black Muslims also feel the brunt of overpolicing and state
violence. The criminalization of Black Muslim communities makes me
deeply aware that I live in a White supremacist, Christo-centric society that
spends billions to bomb, drone, and surveil people who look like me and
pray the same way I do.
      From Nabra Hassanen to Stephon Clark, Black Muslim bodies are
vulnerable. State policies targeting Muslims embolden White supremacists
to commit hate crimes and attack our women. Yet in movement spaces,
Black Muslims are often marginalized. And the media erases the role we
play on our streets, reaching over us to amplify the voices of non-Black
Arab and South Asian activists. My work centers Black Muslims while
maintaining a transnational lens that explains how neoliberal policies and
the military-prison industrial complex cause mass suffering. I have
organized forums, convenings, and Twitter town halls exploring the linkages
and exchanges on what we have termed the “Black Muslim Atlantic.” Black
Muslims bridge continental divides and cross oceans to form a distinct
culture. We connect through migration, travel, exchanges of ideas, and
borrowing and inspiration in dress, music, and art. We find intertwined
roots and routes to connect our struggles. While the criminal justice,
national security, and immigration systems target us, we forge shared
futures and spaces where we can be free. This has been central to my work
in antiracism education.
      And the seeds of the embodied work of connecting were sown that day
in Fez almost fifteen years ago. As my classmates and I walked with our
tour group through neighborhoods that predated Western ascendancy, I felt
the full measure of what it meant to be Black outside the United States and
a Muslim in a Muslim-majority nation. Morocco’s ancient palaces and
heritage sites evoked an era outside the reach of White supremacy. We
wound through old neighborhoods, including the Andalusian area, where
the Moors and Jews resettled after their expulsion from Spain in 1492. It
wasn’t all lost to the Reconquista or French colonialism or neocolonialism.
There was still beauty there, even as we faced the crushing effect of
neoliberal policies on Black and Brown bodies.
My professor introduced me to a caretaker of the shrine of Saint Ahmed
Tijani. French colonial law’s mark remained, forbidding non-Muslims from
entering mosques. Leaving my classmates behind, I became more than a
tourist when I walked alone through that large keyhole-shaped doorway. I
became a worshiper.
The space opened into a courtyard with a prayer hall facing east. I went
to the fountains to perform my ritual washing to prepare for congregational
prayers, and I encountered beautiful West African women with ebony,
mahogany, and chestnut skin tones wearing jewel-toned gowns. It was the
season for the annual pilgrimage of West Africans to the shrine. One
woman assisted me as I clumsily made my ritual ablutions, not from a water
faucet like at home, but by dipping a cup and pouring the water over my
extremities. I washed the dust away from my face, my arms, and my feet,
feeling refreshed after hours in the hot summer sun. We walked to the
prayer hall, and the African pilgrims gestured to the tawny and beige
Moroccan women. We synchronized to form straight prayer lines, shoulder
to shoulder, foot to foot. White supremacy seeks to divide us, but in Fez,
those of us who spoke English, French, and Moroccan Darijah raised our
hands to our shoulders in an act of surrender and said, together, “Allahu

## Akbar, God is the Greatest.”

## Building a New Community

## Rev. Dr. Valerie Bridgeman

The sermon that I offer here was preached on March 3, 2018, at Alfred
Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia. As a Hebrew Bible/Old
Testament Womanist scholar, I usually preach the Hebrew biblical text, and
so I didn’t “choose” the text during that third week of Lent, so much as I
wrestled with the Revised Common Lectionary text to the point where I
could make sense of something that is “common” to people. I mean, even
people who don’t know the Bible know the Ten Commandments. But for it
to be a liberating text of resistance, I needed to put it in the context of a
formerly enslaved people who were trying to figure out how to be a
liberated community.
Part of the genius of the Black preaching tradition is finding new ways to
approach old texts. I find naming the questions, and siding with those who
have them (both in the word and outside the word), part of the liberating
work of preaching. As I say in the sermon, this particular approach was a
first for me. Reading it again, I don’t think I would say that they didn’t know
God in Egypt. I would say that they knew God under the duress of bondage.
That’s not the same thing, because I believe divine wisdom is with us no
matter what. I would also do more resistance of those verses about slavery.
If I have a regret for this sermon, that is the biggest—I didn’t push back in
the proclamation moment against the presumption that slavery was a given,
or that wives and slaves and donkeys were all property not to be coveted.
That needs to be roundly resisted in a new community. That too is the
genius of preaching: you get to correct yourself.
I am, in my mind, always destroying and building as I go—by which I
mean destroying commonly held beliefs that do not foster anything but
pacified religion in order to build bold and bodacious faith that questions
and demands dialogical faith. For me, that is the very nature of resistance.

## The Sermon

Let’s turn our attention now to the text for tonight. We’re reading what I
believe is familiar to all of you today. It’s Exodus 20:1–17. You may not
know how familiar it is, but it ought to be familiar to you. Listen, I’m
reading from the New Revised Standard Version. See if in the listening of
this word you will not hear from God.
“Then God spoke all of these words. I am the Lord your God who
brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall
have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol
whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above or that is on the
earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down
to them or worship them.
“For I the Lord your God, I’m a jealous God, punishing children for the
iniquity of parents to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject
me, but show a steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love
me and keep my commandments. You shall not make wrongful use of the
name of the Lord your God.” (I think the King James says, “You shall not

## take the name of the Lord your God in vain.”)

“For the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses His name. Remember
the Sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your
work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. You shall
not do any work, you, your son, or your daughter, your male or female slave,
your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns.
“Well in six days the Lord made a heaven and earth, the sea and all that
is in them, but rested the seventh day. Therefore, the Lord blessed the
Sabbath and consecrated it. Honor your father and your mother so that your
days may be long in the land that the Lord your God has given you. You
shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You
shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet your
neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or male or
female slave or ox or donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
Prayer: God, the lion has roared. Who will not fear? God has spoken.
Who can but prophesy? We come again to this time and to these texts, and
we ask that you speak a word to the listening of your people so that we may
hear what the Spirit is saying to the church. Arrest our attention and help us,
oh God, to hear you clearly and to respond to you with our whole hearts, our
whole lives. I pray this in the name of all that’s holy, in the presence of all
of our ancestors, and in the strong name of Jesus. And the people of God
say amen.
You may be seated.
Now I know you know these words as the Ten Commandments. You may
have heard them called the Decalogue. My Jewish friends call them the Ten
Sayings or the Ten Matters. But it turns out that if you really read this text
closely, there are really only three things in the text. Before I tell you what
they are, I want to back up in time and take you back to before these words
were spoken.
They are standing right now at Mount Sinai, but before they get to
Mount Sinai, you may remember that they had been in bondage in Egypt.
These ancient Israelites who make their way—three months after the last
plague, standing at Mount Sinai—for generations had been told that they
would be delivered from Egypt.
They had heard from their parents that there was a God who listened to
their prayers and loved them. But imagine, if you will, how many
generations you are in and people are still saying, “God will deliver us.”
And you are now the fortieth generation. The God of your parents, Abraham
and Isaac and Jacob, and the women who came along with them.
Not just their wives but their second wives and their concubines, and
everyone that they gave birth to, had been told that God would give them a
land of their own. And had been told that they would live in freedom, but
it’s been four hundred years. And they had not heard from God. And it
wasn’t for lack of trying, for the scripture says that they had cried out to
God many times and that they had cried out to God under the burden of
slavery. That in the heat of the day and under the whip, they had cried out to
God. They had said the prayers that their parents had taught them. They had
cried out to God.
I don’t know, maybe you know something about this. We have
domesticated this text and we have made it easy. We make it sound good
that they’ve come so quickly and so easily to Mount Sinai, but it had been
four hundred years of crying out to God.
As far as they could tell, the heavens were brass, the heavens were silent.
God was not listening to them. They didn’t know, they didn’t know that
Moses would one day go and run into God out in Midian. They didn’t know,
while they were crying out, that the murderer Moses would become the
deliverer. They didn’t know.
In fact, if you remember the story right, they didn’t even like Moses.
They didn’t trust him. It is not uncommon that the people that God lifts up
to lead us are often folk that we don’t know whether we’re going to trust
them or not. That’s not uncommon, but it had been years. And so, when
Moses showed up and said that “the God of your ancestors has spoken to
me,” and says to go and “set you free” and that “I’m going to go to Pharaoh
on your behalf,” they were like, “We don’t know this God.” Think about
that. The people who had been crying out to God did not know the God they
were crying out to.
And so, you know the story: There were plagues and there was praying;
and there were plagues and there was praying; and finally, on that last
dreadful plague where death overtook the land, they were set free to run for
their lives. Oh, I know they plundered the people, including taking some of
the people’s slaves. God didn’t say nothing to them about taking nobody’s
slaves, but they did. Because you understand that when you are under
oppression, the only thing you know is how to oppress. And so they had
learned from Pharaoh that they needed some slaves.
It didn’t occur to them that they could build the community where
everybody was free. It didn’t occur to them because they had been under
slavery. You learn what you have been under. You learn that. And so they
took slaves and they took bangles and bobbles and they took animals and
they went running for their lives.
They didn’t go skipping out of Egypt. They weren’t sure what Pharaoh
was going to do and they were right to not trust Pharaoh because the next
## *
morning they found themselves between Pharaoh and the Reed Sea, and
they needed a way out of no way to survive. They needed a path through the
waters, an escape route. I really want you to get a picture, a sense of what
they must have felt: slaves running for their lives and Pharaoh on their
tracks, right? Like you really have to understand, because I think we have
domesticated this text so much that we can’t feel the terror that they felt.
And so there they are at the Reed Sea and Moses is hearing from God,
but they are hearing nothing. And they are looking at Moses like, “It would
have been better to die, we were going to die in Egypt anyhow, but now you
gonna bring us out here in the middle of nowhere.” And I know, I know
we’re so saved that we say we would have never said that, but I’m with
them. I’m with them. They don’t know. It’s been four hundred years. They
have not heard God speak. They’ve only heard the stories of how God
works.
    Maybe it works like this in your life: your grandmama, your mama, your
daddy, your granddaddy, your auntie, and your uncle, they all got great
stories of how God has been in their life, but here you are in your twenties
and thirties and forties and you ain’t never heard God say nothing.
    And life has been hard for you. “Life ain’t been no crystal stair.” And
you smile at Thanksgiving dinner while they’re telling those stories. But in
your mind, you are like, If God loves us so much, how come? How come?
Four hundred years and all they had were the stories of God. And then God
shows up. Yes, God shows up.
    Three months after this deliverance, they have had to eat manna in the
wilderness. Manna, you may know, means “What is it?” It is not anything
deep. Like they actually asked, “What is this?” There’s no deep revelation in
it. They were just like, “What is this?” Moses was like, “Y’all complaining
about food, I’ve given you food. Eat the food.” Bread. The Psalmist would
later call it the bread of angels. But they didn’t know anything about what
angels ate. It was just something on the ground that they had never seen. It
didn’t look like the onions and the leeks of Egypt that they were familiar
with. It didn’t look like something they knew what it was. You all know
what it’s like when you are in a situation where God is doing something
new and it doesn’t look like nothing you’ve ever seen. You are yourself,
running around going, “What is it?” So, “What is it?”
    And then they got thirsty and they were like, “You brought us out here to
die.” Now I know we’ve got hindsight, so we’re like, “We would have never
done that because God had given them manna from heaven. We would have
known that God will still give us water from the rock.” Nooooo.
    I grew up in Alabama. When it hits 105 and you count the days in
hundreds, not in, you know—we’re on day five, we’re on day forty of 100plus degrees. If anybody grew up in the South, you know what I’m talking
about. You’re like—water is better than most anything else. (I can’t say what
I was really thinking. But use your sanctified imagination—or not
sanctified!)
They had manna, and now they were thirsty, then God provided water.
All of this happens in three months and now. Now. They are standing at
Mount Sinai, the place that Moses said that God was going to bring them, to
bring them to worship, and to hear from God. And they actually hear from
God and it’s terrifying.
Most of us—if we tell the whole truth—want a mediated voice from
God. We want somebody else to speak on God’s behalf. We do not want to
hear from God ourselves, and I ain’t mad at you. Let me just say, I’m not
mad at you about that because the voice of God terrified them. Terrified
them.
And what God spoke was literally three things. I know it’s ten, but it’s
really three. The first thing God says, “No other gods. Don’t make graven
images, don’t take my name in vain.” That’s one thing that we made into
three.
Basically, God says, “Get to know me. I know you don’t know me. I
know you know about me. I know you have heard about me. I know you’ve
got stories about me, but what I really want is for you to get to know me. I
don’t want you to talk prepositionally about who I am. I really want you to
get to know me. I’m the God who brought you out of Egypt. I am the God
who bore you up on eagle’s wings. I am the God who brought you onto

## myself. Get to know me.”

The first part of the Ten Commandments, the first three, are “get to know
me.” Get to know me. I don’t know where you are in your journey and
maybe your faith is still tethered to somebody else’s story of how God is,
but God is inviting you to get to know God for yourself.
My pastor when I was growing up used to like to say—growing up in
both the Baptist and the Holiness church I was really confused—but let me
just say, I believed this. My Holiness growing-up pastor used to say to us,
“God has no grandchildren. God only has children.”
You get what he’s saying? That our faith is not inherited like we inherit
money. Our faith is not inherited like we inherit the quilt that our
grandmother is handing down to us. What we get to know about God we
have to get to know for ourselves. “Don’t put anybody else in front of me,
get to know me for yourself.”
We like mediated space between us and God. Sometimes we mediate
that space with drinks, sometimes we mediate that space with sex,
sometimes we mediate that space with the work we do, sometimes we
mediate that space with our family and our friends. But God is saying, “I
want some unmediated space between me and you.”
“Get to know me. Get to know me.” God knew, God knew, God
understood that, all those years in bondage, what they knew about God was
really kind of fantastical in their mind. They had not seen, they had not
heard for themselves. They had not experienced God for themselves. They
had prayed, but they had not had experiences.
And maybe they had assigned to some other deities, some other entities,
some other energy, what only belonged to God. Maybe you are doing some
of that yourself. Maybe the church is doing some of that. The way in which
we in community find a way to mediate between us and God. Get to know
me for yourself.
The second thing that’s in this text that literally, before I started trying to
think about this sermon for us, I had missed—the second thing is get to
loving yourself. Now I know you don’t think it’s there because it doesn’t say
that, but what it says is observe the Sabbath and keep it holy. Six days God
worked and did everything and then rested.
God theologized rest, otherwise known as self-care. God theologized for
them self-care. Do it because I do it. Do it because I did it. You need to
learn to love yourself enough to rest. Now imagine being a slave where you
worked eighteen to twenty hours a day every day and you never got a
Sabbath, and to hear at Mount Sinai, “Take a rest.” You deserve to rest. You
deserve it because the God who called you created you and created rest.
Imagine what it’s like. Sister Andrea James helped us today when we
were talking about women and girls in incarceration and she talked about
how, when mothers get out of jail, that the first thing they want to do for a
long time is sleep. Because they have spent all that time guarding
themselves against sexual assault and physical assault and working from
sunup to sundown in our carceral state and what they want is rest.
And how about God wants that for them. And God wants that for us. So,
if you find yourself working so hard that you can’t think, you are not loving
yourself and God calls us, in these words, to love ourselves with rest. And
theologizes it; God theologizes it. “I did it. I did it. I did it, and if you get to
know me like I’m telling you to get to know me, you will understand that
getting to know me means I want you to rest like I rested.” You all with me?
Get to rest.
And then the third thing that’s here is pretty obvious, which is love your
neighbor. Love God, love yourself, love your neighbor. That’s it. It ain’t that
deep. It really is not that deep. How do I know that God is calling you to
love your neighbor?
Well, honor your father and your mother: those are the nearest neighbors
you’ve got. Your close kinfolk, the people that you’ve got to live with every
day, they are the hardest people to love. Go on and say amen, everybody, so
won’t nobody feel bad. Your nearest kin are the hardest ones to honor and
treat right.
I remember one time my mother, somebody was telling her, “Oh, Mrs.
Bridgeman, you would have been so proud of your daughter.” And she was
telling her what I’d done. And my mother—as only my mother could, may
she rest in peace—said, “Are we talking about the same Valerie?” You
know, because you do right out in public.
Your parents have taught you to act like you got some home training.
You better act like you know what your name is. These are the things I grew
up with. You better remember who your mama is. So when you went out in
public, you took that with you. But you didn’t always act as well at home as
you did in public. Okay, well, I didn’t always act as well.
Some of you are better than me in this area, so maybe you have always
been just as good at home as you are out in public. Well, for me and my
house and my children when they… the notion of longevity connected to
honoring our parents… of course it is a part of their culture that you honor
the elders, you honor your parents, but it is also the way in which you
monitor your regrets and your resentments.
When we honor people, we learn how not to hold on to resentments and
regrets. Some of us are dying from the inside right now because we are still
holding something over the head of our parents or over the head of our
children, over the head of our siblings. Something they did and they have
long forgotten, but you are still nursing that thing and not honoring them.
Learn to love your nearest neighbor. The rest of it is pretty self-evident.
Don’t kill nobody. I don’t think I need to say anything else about those.
Please don’t do it. Stop touching people! Don’t do it. Just don’t do it. This
adultery piece needs a little bit of explication. Don’t get quiet. I used to
worry about this in the Decalogue, not because I think you should commit
adultery, not that, but because I know us.
We always reduce things to sex. But Professor Esther Acolatse, who
teaches pastoral theology—now at the University of Toronto, used to be at
Duke—says, “Adultery is wrong, not because of sex.” I know that’s the way
that we have filtered it out, particularly in the Pauline epistles, but it’s wrong
because of the way in which it breaks company in community.
It’s wrong because of what it does, not just to the two people involved
and their spouses or partners, but to everybody connected in that eventually,
it hurts everyone. I hope I don’t tell too much of this story so that the person
recognizes themselves, but if they do, you do the deed… I’m just saying.
This brother had not one, not two, not three, but four on-the-side chicks.
Now, I don’t even know how they do that. Don’t tell me, I don’t want to
know, because then I’m going to wonder how you know. And I don’t want to
have that in my head! Right? And his children knew. His wife suspected a
couple, but she didn’t know about all of them. The children knew. And other
people knew, most specifically, his boys knew.
And he had a heart attack, not at home. Yeah, I see you all got a picture.
And let’s just say he was not dressed for the ER, right? So he gets to the ER
and dies, and they called his next of kin, who is his wife on the paper.
Where’s his clothes? Where is his car? His boys knew. That broke
relationship not just with her and him.
She thought they were his friends and they’re her friends too, but they
were covering for him. So at the time that she needed them most, she
couldn’t trust them. It wasn’t about the sex. It literally was about the broken
community. Sex is incidental. Even if you’re really, really good at it, it
doesn’t take that long. But is it worth what it does to community? (I’m a

## woman of a certain age, what can I tell you.)

Love God, love God, love God. Get to know God. Love yourself. Rest,
rest, rest in the assurance that God loves you, and rest enough to know that
you don’t have to perform to be loved. And then get some do right in your
spirit. And love your neighbors. Treat them well.
This, as it turns out, would become the sum total of the law and the
prophets. These words were aspirational, they were not even written in stone
at this point. That doesn’t happen until four or five chapters later, and even
when they are written in stone, the people are so flaky that they get broken.
These words are not written in stone because God knows humans and
our propensity to idols and our propensity to try to work our way into being
okay. God knows our propensity toward nursing grudges and treating people
wrong, but to build a new community, these people stood at Mount Sinai
and listened for words that would help them try to figure out what being free
folk would look like; what it would take to build a relationship with God
and with one another that is beyond the terror and the trials they lived for
generations in slavery. These Three Revelations that we call the Ten
Commandments—love God, love yourself, love your neighbor—are the
foundational building blocks for a new community, a just community. They
are words of life to a people fresh out of bondage. They are words for life
for us if we are going to build a new community, one built on justice and
love. Let’s build a new community. May it be so.

## The Calling

It was the music that brought her back.
Before she was a bishop, Jacquelyn Holland was a little Black girl
splitting her time between the Pentecostal church and a home that was ruled
by the Pentecostal church. “My mother raised us in the church, and I was
taught from a young age how to pray and to believe in God,” explains the
native of Charlotte, North Carolina. “It was very orthodox. You weren’t
supposed to listen to any music besides gospel, you weren’t supposed to
wear pants as a woman, you weren’t supposed to party. We basically went to
church most of the time—and bowled. We were allowed to bowl for some
reason.”
She felt a calling even then; her teenage self organized other young
people from the church to visit their peers’ homes and pray with them. But
she was never encouraged to go into the ministry. “Women were able to
preach, but we weren’t able to be pastors,” Holland says. But she was
encouraged to get married, so she did that at the age of twenty and settled
into life as a junior high school teacher and mom of two boys.
Six years later, she separated from her husband, came out as a lesbian,
and left her church, despite the constant pull she felt toward the ministry. “In
the Pentecostal church, we were taught that to be gay was against God,”
Holland says. “I never gave up my relationship with God, but I decided I
wasn’t going to go into ministry because I wasn’t going to lie, I wasn’t going
to be in the closet anymore. If God didn’t accept me, there was no reason for
me to try,” Holland says.
And then came the music.
She started singing with a group called Lavender Light, and it was full
of people of color who identified as queer. “When I started singing with the
choir, I felt for the first time that I could connect with God and be gay at the
same time,” she says. Her new family introduced her to the Unity
Fellowship Church Movement (UFCM) in 1992. “There, I was taught that
God loves everybody—lesbian, gay, bisexual, all people—and that God
does not discriminate based on your sexual orientation,” she says. Her
calling validated, she quickly became assistant pastor in the UFCM’s New
York City church, and later she started a new congregation across the river
in Newark, New Jersey.
These days they put a “Bishop” before her name at UFCM, which
describes itself as the “oldest open-and-affirming, progressive Black Church
founded to reach primarily Black queer, same gender-loving and LGBT
Christians.” Founded in a Los Angeles home in 1982, the church now has
fifteen sanctuaries dedicated to being a refuge for people fighting for justice
under the mantra “God is love and love is for everyone.” In her role, Holland
helps manage the movement, counseling the pastors, setting policy for the
denomination, and making sure it meets its mission.
Her big-picture goal is to create a space that feels inclusive. “Unity is
based on this message of love, the love that Jesus talked about, loving God
with all your heart and all your mind, and loving your neighbor as yourself,”
Holland says. “We created these spaces because we were not welcomed in
other spaces. But a real, freeing worship experience should be so powerful
and so welcoming that everybody should feel included. I want my legacy to
be one where Jesus’s message of love is a lived experience. I want the world
to say we made a difference.”

## QUESTION, ANSWERED

The question we tackle here is: how do you keep the faith?

## Akiba

The question “How do you keep the faith?” assumes that I know how to
do it. It assumes that I have the strength to resist feeling defensive and
exposed about the matter, or that my conscious mind even works this way. I
wish I had a less clichéd way to say it, but the jury’s still out on faith for me.
How I came to this particular kind of heathendom has all of the markers
of growing up Black and “political” in the ’70s and ’80s. I never, ever, not
once looked at that drawing of White Jesus with the flat-ironed blond hair
and the Scope-colored eyes and believed that Black folks had any business
praying to “Him.” That wasn’t even Him.
I knew that slavers and other genocidal motherfuckers used some fuckshit that Ham did eons ago to justify some of humanity’s worst crimes.
I grew up saying grace, but a Swahili one that my father and mother
created. I was and am Kwanzaa-only. Never did a cross, a tree, or a
sugarplum fairy enter our home.
My mother’s general theory of humanity is that we are a failed
experiment. She often quips that if the people at the Episcopal church she
went to as a kid sang better, she might still give it the time of day.
Meanwhile, my poor father has always been uneasy about and, I suspect,
resentful of the irreverence my sister and I inherited from our mother, who
is hilarious and brilliant and perfect, thank you very much. But at most, he
behaved as a closet Christian with an affinity for liberation theology during
our formative years.
Still, I am an adult. I have had plenty of opportunities to figure out a
practice that cultivates and sustains my spirit, the lynchpin of faith as I
understand it. I did try and fail at Buddhism. Islam never called my name.
Culturally speaking, Christianity is the default. There’s a huge amount of
pressure for us to “draw on the faith of our ancestors.” We’re taught to put
the dramatic and mundane savagery of White supremacy in God’s hands.
This makes me deeply ambivalent about what the Lord appears to be
doing or allowing. I’m embarrassed by this, especially as an African
American woman who does actually believe in justice, joy, peace, comfort,
growth, and health for my people and most other beings on this planet.
To that end, in my younger years, I tattooed two God-related Adinkra
symbols on my back. One means “child of God,” which is evidence of my
yearning. Another means “the omnipotence of God,” which is what it is.
What I know for sure is that some Black person in my life is always losing
their mom or dad prematurely, getting laid off, getting cancer, burying their
child, having a sudden heart attack, being terrorized by police, or trying to
push through the trauma of homophobia or sexual violence. Piety does not
seem to save them.
I am authentically moved by gospel music like the kind Walter Hawkins,
Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin, Kelly Price, and Chance the Rapper’s
cousin Nicole are responsible for. I hear God happening in every brilliant
bend and ad lib. I believe that God used Nina Simone to open up the
possibility that we might be haughty and angry rather than supplicant in the
face of racism. I hear this music and something physical happens to me that
I can best describe as a pulsing in my chest and welling at the back of my
throat. But when the music stops, I’m right back in my hard head.
Incidentally, I used to sing well enough to solo for my high school
gospel choir. They let me onstage despite the fact that I was always
marching in the wrong direction. In college, I was in a band, wrote songs
every day, and did a few tracks for a girl group. I had a couple of managers
and a voice coach who I adored and who died. During my early 2000s stint
at Essence magazine, a few of us came together and killed “Oh Lord, How
Excellent” and the Sister Act version of “Joyful, Joyful” at the Time Inc.
holiday party.
But then I got sick and somebody (Satan?) marred my voice with an
unintentional rasp and a flatness in my lower register. Just like that, one of
my most dependable pleasures in life became a reminder of the worst
moments in my life.
At this point, it would be helpful for me to be specific about what I mean
when I say, “I got sick.” What that means is that I am clinically depressed
and that this illness has led to what medical professionals politely call
“decompensation” and I call “losing my fucking mind for a minute.”
I have decompensated twice in my life. The second and last time
(because I am never going back there, trust) an auntie who is a Yoruba
priestess came up from South Carolina to perform a ritual that would banish
the sickness and danger from my soul. She identified my Orisha and told me
to start wearing white. She also told me I should come stay in her village for
a while, so I could finally get off meds for good. This is not going to
happen.
She’s not the only loved one who has imagined that a better connection
with God would trump my chemical imbalance. One of my exes—a lapsed
Muslim with a stunningly self-serving patchwork of practices—told me we
could together replace my meds with a spiritual practice that honored the
true nature of man and woman.
Another ex, whose religion could best be described as “quasi Five
Percenter from Harlem,” told me that he could replace my psychotherapist
with himself, some sage, and some prayer.
This other dude you actually know: Chew Stick Fuckboi the Third. I did
not tell him about my depression because he was too busy being Old
Testament about sharing a bed with a woman who was menstruating and
“protecting” the kids he had conceived via premarital sex from being
dragged to hell by gay serpents.
I believe that everyone except Chew Stick truly meant well. I believe that
every Black person blessed enough to know and practice rituals that feed
their spirit want everyone else to get this good thing too. We do love each
other very much, and that is an act of faith.
I also know that I am blessed by the amazing people who love me, the
fact that I can make a decent living, and my suite of great health benefits.
No one I am close to has been maimed or murdered. I know in my heart—
and from their texts and live-action hinting around—that my good peoples
believe in me. One of my girls even gave me a get-well card with “I believe
in you!” written inside.
On my low days, I feel sorrow for what I suspect is my chemically
determined inability to throw myself into spirit and faith and stay there. On
my best days, I meditate on my loved ones and the miracle that is my life. I
may be wracked by ambivalence and anger, but I never doubt that my folks
have faith in me. If I am ever going to learn how to keep the faith, I will
learn it by watching them and loving them back, fiercely.

## Kenrya

I’ve always had an interesting relationship with God. As far back as I can
remember, I’ve thought of Him as my homeboy. Brown, with a big ’fro,
always listening, even when our conversations are happening in my head. I
carry His heart with me (I carry it in my heart), and He gives me comfort,
peace, and mixed signals when I’m shady, laughing a little, while also
admonishing me to do unto others and all that. Our relationship is the
epitome of the definition of faith that has always stuck with me: “Now faith
is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen”
(Hebrews 11:1, New King James Version).
But as a child, I worried that wasn’t enough. I didn’t grow up in the
church. We prayed over all our meals and sometimes at night, but I didn’t
regularly attend worship service until I was old enough to drive myself in
our little maroon Dodge Plymouth. By that time, my father was going to his
own church, but when I was younger, it seemed he was more interested in
sucking up all the knowledge he could get than spending his Sundays on a
pew. When Jehovah’s Witnesses knocked on our door, not only did my
daddy not turn off the television and ignore the door—he invited them in for
Bible study and even took us to a meeting at the local Kingdom Hall. He
didn’t just buy bean pies from the men of the Nation of Islam who stood in
traffic selling treats and copies of The Final Call to people stopped at the
light on Lee and Harvard in Cleveland—he bought cassette tapes of
Farrakhan speeches that he played on his hi-fi stereo system on weekends.
We weren’t affiliated with a church, but I felt like I was enveloped by
God’s presence, like our willingness to open our hearts to many ways of
worship brought us even closer to the Lord. It made me understand at an
early age that spirituality and religion are not the same, that we all have to
find our own ways to faith if that’s what we desire. But by the time my
teenage self joined a citywide gospel choir, I had developed a deep
inferiority complex, ’cause teenagers carry around sooooo many fucks. I
wasn’t well versed in the old hymns of the church, I didn’t yet know the
“Doxology,” and I worried that my lack of concentrated religious training
wasn’t pleasing to… the other kids in the choir.
My perceived otherness made me meek(er), even though back then my
soprano was clear and sweet, more than capable of taking on the lead vocal
in the latest Kirk Franklin song. It felt like I, the unchurched, hadn’t earned
the right to sing “Now Behold the Lamb” for the congregation at Antioch
Baptist Church.
Some might say I was kinda right.
I had to audition to be invited to join the choir, which meant preparing a
song that showcased my voice. My fourteen-year-old self was torn between
two songs: Aaliyah’s version of the Isley Brothers’ “At Your Best” and
“Stroke You Up,” a song from the girl group Changing Faces that was
penned by Robert Kelly and talks about ways to please a penis.
Yo.
I subjected my father to a trial run, where I stood before him and sang
both songs so he could help me pick the right one to perform. How this
negro kept a straight face, I will never know. “Well, you clearly have a lot of
passion when you sing ‘Stroke You Up,’” he said when I finished. “But ‘At

## Your Best’ is so beautiful.”

Clearly, I needed Jesus.
And He has always been there. The reality is, I never imagined that there
was an option not to keep the faith. Yes, I knew that there were atheists and
agnostics out there who didn’t subscribe to a higher power of some type.
But it never occurred to me to opt out. Not as a young Black girl whose
daddy never met an evangelist he didn’t like, and certainly not as an adult
who has an intimate relationship with both trauma and joy.
When I was twenty-five years old, a very dear friend died in a
motorcycle accident. I was devastated. I could barely stay in my skin, sitting
up at all hours of the night unable to close my eyes out of fear, working in a
darkened office for months because there was no more light for me, holding
my breath to see if I could just fade away and not have to confront the hole
left in the world. But even in the middle of my grief, I vividly remember
thinking, This would be so much harder if I did not have faith. If I did not
believe that this isn’t all that there is. If I did not have a track record of
surviving my worst days because God propelled me through them.
    Four years later, I took a pregnancy test just before getting in the car for
a three-hour drive to a funeral. It was bittersweet, learning that I was
carrying new life as we were about to say goodbye to my then-husband’s
aunt. But I marveled that day—and even on the many, many, many days that
I was unbelievably sick during my pregnancy—that God was doing amazing
things in my body. I don’t know how to make a baby! I mean, I have the sex
part down, but the whole dividing cells and creating a brain stem and
fingernails and eyelids? Nah, homie, that’s not me. And yet. It was
happening, every minute of every day in my little retroverted uterus. And
she came out of my vagina, y’all. Pale, not crying at first, because the
umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck, then wailing until she was
placed on my breasts. If that’s not evidence that there is a God, I literally
don’t know what is.
    Listen. I have never seen a day where White supremacy didn’t impact
where I live, the work I do, or the way my child views herself. But I have
faith that that day exists. Faith that one day we will only know a world that
resembles Wakanda (without all the hoarding of vibranium). Faith that the
history books that focus on our time spent enslaved will add new chapters
that detail how we successfully demolished the idea of Whiteness and the
oppression it has wrought. Faith that a force not seen is ordering our steps
toward freedom. Onward.

## YOU CAN’T TELL ME NOTHIN’

The typical telling of why style is so essential to Black survival would begin with the violence of the Middle Passage. It would conjure up brown
skin cracked and almost silver with ash, hair matted with dust and dander,
clothes too tattered to protect violated bodies from the heat, cold, fleas, and
burrs.
Of course, that story—one of strength to be sure—is true. But it is
incomplete. Take the magic of our hair. Before the European narcissists
kidnapped us and dragged us across the world, we used our cornrows,
braids, thread wrapping, and ornaments to communicate to one another who
we were. Ayana Byrd and Lori L. Tharps’s Hair Story, the definitive social
history of African American hair, lays it out:
In the early 15th century, hair functioned as a carrier of messages in most West
African societies. The citizens of these societies—including the Wolof, Mende,
Mandingo, and Yoruba—were the people who filled the slave ships that sailed to
the “New World.” Within these cultures, hair was an integral part of a complex
language system. Ever since African civilizations bloomed, hairstyles have been
used to indicate a person’s marital status, age, religion, ethnic identity, wealth, and
rank within the community. In some cultures a person’s surname could be
ascertained simply by examining the hair because each clan had its own unique
hairstyle. The hairstyle also served as an indicator of a person’s geographic origins.
And of course, our style isn’t limited to hair. We put our babies’ freshly
bathed and oiled bodies into quality garb so that this hostile world won’t
assume that they are not loved. Our big geometric hats, high heels, and skirt
suits are part of how we honor the divine. Steve Harvey suits, Carmelo
Anthony suits, and our favorite, Mahershala Ali suits, tell the world that we
intend to act good and grown and very sexy. Our shoe game defies reason
and sometimes budget, which isn’t so great, but it feels great and pleasure is
something we deserve.
We also stunt on haters with our cleverness and our pride in our intellect.
How many times have you seen that article about Michael Brown, the
Black, Houston-based senior who applied to twenty colleges and got free
rides from all of them? Who is more wicked with Photoshop than our
freelance meme-makers who skillfully mocked the Oakland White woman
who called the police on two Black men barbecuing? For us, style is more
than capitalist materialism and unhealthy competition. The creators in this
chapter show us why.

## Michael Arceneaux on Shade as Resistance

Michael Arceneaux is a Houston-born writer for Elle, New York, the
Guardian, Ebony, and Complex and the author of a comedic memoir about
being unapologetically Black, gay, and sexual called I Can’t Date Jesus.
Akiba and Kenrya chatted with Arceneaux about the art of employing shade
as resistance and why a little disrespect just might save us all.
If you ruled the world and everything in it, what would you
change?
Student loans are the bane of my existence. I basically took out a payday
loan to go to Howard. So if I ruled, I would start by making higher
education free.
What else would you do?
Well, if I could bippity-boppity-boo one thing for everyone, it would be
to make them less concerned about what other people think. People forced a
lot of stuff on me early on. Now I’m more myself.
So you stopped caring?
Well, a lot of people would call it “no fucks given,” but I find that it can
be a false premise. We typically care what other people think, no matter
what. It’s just that we can’t let what people think control us. We should just
have this kind of openness, this embracing of doing whatever we want. I
wish I could be as free as like a Cardi B or Joseline Hernandez. People try
to trivialize what they do, but they remind me of people I grew up with.
Even though they’re broken in some places, they’re rewarded for being who
they are.
So to take that to the macro level, how can not caring about
what other people think help Black people to resist?
Sometimes, when we talk—even if we’re talking about ourselves and
identity and race—we are being reactive to what White people think. If I
ruled the world, I would free Black people from ever having to think about
White people in a way that centers them.
How does this play out for you?
If I’m around White gay people and they ask about dating, they want me
to talk about it within the context of “White men don’t want me. It’s sexual
racism.” Because I’m a Black gay man, they assume that I’m broken and
miserable and that I’m walking around so burdened by their prejudices. But
I don’t give a fuck about White people like that. I’m very much aware of
politics and what’s going on, but I don’t wake up every morning thinking
about what White people like or what they’re going to do to me.
How did you grow up?
Growing up, I was mostly around Black people and Latinos. I dealt with
Latino racism to an extent, but it was just different from having to deal with
White racists. So I’ve always had a Black center. I didn’t grow up with
money, but I knew that Black people could become doctors and lawyers. So
even though I’m the first man in my family to go to college, I didn’t think
anything was impossible.
You grew up Catholic, right?
Yes. I got approached for the priesthood at twenty by a Black priest in a
curly wig! The only things I associated with being gay were “the AIDS” and
hell. Literally, that’s all I knew. My book is like my education about how to
be what I am now: a semiconfident, secure, Colored sissy.
One thing we appreciate about your writing is that you’re
haughty and petty as fuck.
Am I?
Yes, in the best possible way! Once, after 45 tweeted something
late at night, you responded, “Go to bed, thot.” You called the
president of the United States a thot.
I don’t know if I’m petty! I just be talking. I be saying my shit. But I do
think how I deal with people like him is very disrespectful. I give him as
much respect as he gave the first Black president or as he’s given Black
people throughout his whole life. Personally, it’s cathartic, because I get out
my aggression. And I also think it’s cathartic for the Black people I’m
writing for. I never say his name in my writing. That disrespect is a form of
resistance for me, because I don’t think he deserves any of our respect.
What made you call a powerful man a thot?
I know there’s usually a sex assigned to words like “thot,” but I’m a
gender-neutral bitch basher. I call men “bitch” a lot. I almost got in a fight
with my dad for calling him a bitch. So I treat “thot” the same way.
Technically, if you go by the definition, there is no bigger thot than a man
who walks around talking about how he grabs people’s pussies.

## I fight White supremacy by being fabulous.

## —Michell Speight, nonprofit chief of staff

Writer and Editor Penny Wrenn on Making Space Where There

## Is None

I fight White supremacy by being big Black in my small White town. I
fight though I appear not to fight. My weapon is radical self-acceptance, a
personal hospitality that lays down the I-am-because-we-are welcome mat
of Black reception wherever I enter. I show up—proudly, unselfconsciously,
loudly, jauntily—to streets and sidewalks where I’ve no explicit permission
or invitation to be. I turn up my Black Music to drown out the White
Supremacy soundtrack of Americana and folk songs on loop. I am an
uproarious pedestrian, singing Walter Hawkins’s “Thank You” at the top of
my lungs and head-nodding Black passersby while running errands. When
I’m behind the wheel on windows-down-driving sunny days, my joyful
resistance is a bumpin’-ass bangin’-ass Bose sound system reverberating the
horns, keys, and bass of “Black Man” from Songs in the Key of Life.
In small towns, noise ordinances against loud music and the many other
law-enforcing ways of so-called well-meaning White people are the niggercalling, dog-unleashing, and face-spitting racism of our time. In small
towns, the superiority complexes have a way of masquerading as White
shame sans atonement, as a fake kind of humility, as piousness in the wake
of “well, we tried” failures, as hands-up exasperation that believes it is we
who haven’t shown up. So with my Black self, not only do I show up, but I
show off. Big time.

## Beverly “Bevy” Smith’s Formula for Flyness

Bevy Smith has a long record of subversive fabulosity. In the mid-’90s,
when hip-hop was still a subculture, the Harlem native broke ground as Vibe
magazine’s fashion and beauty advertising director. High-end brands were
not interested in marketing to audiences they perceived as ghetto. Smith
helped change their minds.
She went on to serve as a fashion advertising director at Rolling Stone,
bringing fashion and hip-hop stars together for Dinners with Bevy, co-host
Bravo’s Fashion Queens, host morning satellite radio show Bevelations, and
co-host Page Six TV.
One thing that Smith’s résumé may not tell you is that she is a darkskinned, curvaceous, self-described “Blackity, Black” woman over fifty
with short hair. By most measures, she is not supposed to be in the room. So
Smith creates the room. In this as-told-to, she offers some of her
ingredients.

## On Fashion

“I’m from Harlem, and growing up you only had two options. Be fly or
be a bum. Either you were at the lowest rung or you were appropriate for
business. Business could mean that you were ready for the cookout, or you
were ready for a conference room.
“Fashion was a natural interest, as was advertising. So between loving
advertising and being innately fly, it was like heaven to get one of my first
jobs at a fashion advertising agency.”

## On White People

“At the firm, I met these magical White people, who became my patrons.
Although my parents were raised in the Jim Crow South, I never heard any
negativity about White people in my house. Some people grew up with very
woke parents. My parents were like, ‘Work hard. Take care of your family.’
End of fucking story.
“My mother grew up in Durham, North Carolina, in tobacco land and
went to work at thirteen. My father grew up in Yemassee, South Carolina.
He lost his mother and father very early on and was raised by his aunt. Plus
his little sister died of polio. One time I asked my father why he didn’t
march in the Civil Rights Movement. He was like, ‘I was too busy working.’
Interestingly, his family never worked for White people.
“My parents were just not concerned about what some White person was
doing. I never heard that I had to be two times better to get half as far. I
didn’t grow up thinking of them having something that I should want.”

## On Creating an Image

“I would be lying if I said I didn’t care when certain people have
snubbed me. But mostly I care about whether people see me as nuanced.
Some people think I’m just firing on one cylinder. But I am actually very
aware. I like a kee-kee and a cackle as much as anybody else. But you have
to understand that this is an educated approach. I’m saying something witty,
and wit takes intelligence.
“On Page Six TV, I’m set up as the queen of the scene, the person who’s
traveled the world and been a business executive. I didn’t tell them that
that’s how I wanted to be seen; they discerned that fact. I’m never going to
do a show that casts me as the single, big Black bitch who says things like,
‘If only I could stop eating!’ I’m not doing the self-deprecating thing. I
think that’s a dangerous trope that a lot of Black women over the age of
forty who are curvy and dark-skinned fall into on television.”

## On Self-Determination

“This is so sappy, but I believe that everybody’s got their something.
You’ve got to look in the mirror and find it, find what draws other people to
you. I do this thing called Life with Vision that’s going to be the basis of a
self-help book. I’m really trying to teach people to dig deep and figure out
what the fuck they really want to do. Most of us are shrouding, hiding,
running from what it is that we really want to do, for fear of rejection,

“I want to reconstruct the idea of art for people who grew up in
situations similar to my social and economic background. I don’t believe art
should be intimidating or only for the privileged; it’s an outlet for everyone.
As a writer and an artist, I want to show how an object can tell a story and
share an experience. It makes the experience universal and hopefully
through this form of vulnerability creates necessary conversations. I don’t
think art will save nations, but it can reflect current events and ideas and

and just like that,
it is spring again.

## in this poem, I speak of the grandmother

but not of time’s eager shadow
reaching for her legs.
instead, there is no ancestor
that cannot be touched
by a hand four generations younger.
in this poem, we weaponize joy.
gospel is sung during the week
without burying anyone,
because it is what the living demand.
no one dead looks like anyone’s child here,
because there is no one dead here.
there is no child who is not called a child,
even when they have sinned against the earth.
all of our heroes are still living,
their statues bronze and tall on street corners.
jamal from the barbershop. ms. rose who put her foot
in some fried chicken once, and ain’t never pulled it out.
here, no one asks for permission to celebrate their living
and so it is:
the night pulls back its black mask and gives way to more black.
the type that turns the speakers up loud and runs into the streets.
the type that don’t know how to act,
but ain’t here to impress nobody.
a whole city opens its cracked palms and holds the buzzing within.
in this poem, it sounds like a prayer.
not the hushed kind, but the one that arrives on the lips
after a lover trusts you with their undoing.
the kind that comes from a table
where the spades are up and the tea is sweet.
here, everyone black is a church that never burns.
everyone black is the fire themselves.
eternal light, blood still hot and never on the pavement.
if heaven is a place of no pain, let this be heaven.
here, the god of bulletproof rapture is washing a boy’s feet in the river.
the boy looks up, summons every black bird from its nest.

## QUESTION, ANSWERED

Blackness is obviously lit, but to live as a Black person in America is to
be bombarded with the bias and bullshit of other people. Here we consider:
how many fucks do you give at this point?

## Akiba

     I have the rare problem of people believing that I don’t give a single fuck
when I am out here giving anywhere from 65.789 to 1,000.955 fucks at all
times. People who like me describe this misperception with positive words
like “direct” and “outspoken.” Those who can’t stand me err toward “shady”
and even “evil.”
     The truth is, my feelings are easily hurt and I’ve been trained by life to
respond to that pain with anger rather than vulnerability. I don’t tend to yell
at people (anymore). I now use weaponized sarcasm, which is more
efficient, funnier, and lets you give a fuck without admitting it.
     My sarcasm serves me well enough in most hostile environments. But it
has, at times, foiled my attempts to resist racial microaggressions in a
healthy way. In these sunken places, molehills become mountains, puddles
become pools, a single cheese curl becomes a 26-ounce barrel of Chex mix.
     For instance, I, like many a talented Black girl in publishing, was once
underemployed as a freelance fact-checker at predominantly White outlets.
Regardless of race or class, fact-checkers are the media version of
undertakers. We are the ones who drape bangs over bruised foreheads and
speak softly when everyone else is screaming and falling out.
     At these workplaces, many of the people I was tasked with correcting
behaved like the Molly Ringwald character in The Breakfast Club. They
weren’t exactly mean. They just confused their privilege for talent and
thought they were a little better than people who were browner, larger, and
less wealthy.
     At one place, my coworkers not-so-secretly called the fact-checkers’
section of the office “the ghetto.” They would also respond to me correcting
their errors with bizarre, stupid, or irrelevant utterances. “Have you ever
counted your dreadlocks?” one once asked as I tried to get her to focus on
percentages. “But you have a swayback!!!” another remarked after I told her
that it is physically impossible for 99 percent of grown women to lie flat on
the ground with “zero” space between the floor and their backs.
     Most of my coworkers weren’t conscious of what was happening. But I
knew I was being cast as an extra in an early ’80s movie where the
homeboys spend their days stripping cars and menacing unlucky honkies
with switchblades.
Even worse for me were the raised voices, snatched papers, and tears.
While I would try to defuse these tantrums with an even tone and a gentle
pat to the shoulder, my inner self would declare, “I am a Black girl who was
hired to be right. You are a fucking dumbass. Do the math.”
That combination of outward calm and inner rage inevitably resulted in,
you guessed it, sarcasm. “I know I am soooo annoying,” I once heard myself
say. “I could totally be wrong. But I’m pretty sure the secretary of state isn’t
in charge of ordering the president’s paper clips.” (Okay. I never had to tell
anyone something that obvious, but I came very, very close.)
In these moments, the value of barely masking my hostility with “jokes”
was that the tantrum-thrower recognized that she was being clowned but
couldn’t call it out because I hadn’t actually said anything wrong. The
problem was that I stayed very angry and my feelings were still hurt.
Conversations about lipstick and cheese were never really about lipstick and
cheese. They were about what Miss Millie did to Sofia on Christmas.
Today I like to think that better employment helps me give fewer fucks
about winning stupid power struggles and forgiving microaggressions. I do
actually say, “I am hurt,” sometimes. But that petty, shady, sharp-tongued,
sarcastic girl is always on the ready for a battle of wits. Plus, she tells better
stories.

## Kenrya

None, maybe.
So here’s the thing: I’m a food co-op–shopping, cloth-diapering,
aluminum-free deodorant–wearing, birth doula–working hippie. I’ve led
more workshops on the power of vision boarding and daily affirmations than
I can count, and I never met a low-effort craft project I didn’t like (I’m tired,
y’all). So I greeted 2017 crammed into one of my daughter’s tiny wooden
fold-up chairs so I could sit at her teeny wooden table with poster board and
Crayola’s finest to create an intention board to guide me through the next
twelve months. It’s massive and colorful, and it has sections for all the big
areas in my life—parenting, career, friends, fun. You get the picture. In the
section that details how I want to upgrade my lifestyle, alongside “Be kind
to myself” and “Walk by faith,” I wrote “Give fewer fucks” (see “Exhibit
A”).
I made the mistake of telling my bestie, Erica, about my plan to hoard
my fucks.
Her response: “Bitch, you don’t have any more fucks to give.”
She’s not wrong. But that’s a relatively recent development. I used to
have an abundance of fucks. I cared so much. I worried about being
perceived as aggressive when correcting folks who said my name wrong. I
worried that Black men wouldn’t find me attractive when I big-chopped and
freed myself from Saturdays trapped in the salon waiting for a touch-up. I
took great pains to be polite, even when my manners hadn’t been earned. I
was a miniature version of my daddy, extra concerned about keeping the
peace and saying “Yes” even when I wanted to say “Hell, no,” like my
mama.
My life of caring too much put me in a bad place. I’m empathetic by
nature, but when I found myself making a life with a man who was so
threatened by my success that our marriage was only comfortable when I
dimmed my light, I knew I’d taken this caring thing way too far.
But, as usual, God intervened, and I walked away. Away from the
marriage, away from the constant weight of other people’s expectations,
away from consistently putting myself last. Let me tell you: the confidence
that comes with being forced to learn hard lessons is phenomenal. Once I
realized how great it felt to be my whole, unrelenting, brilliant self, fretting
about what other people thought about me ceased to be an option.
And my recovered glow informs the way I move through the world as a
Black woman. I center my work around dismantling White supremacy. I
never do that whisper thing—you know what I’m talking about—when
talking about race or White people in public. I teach my daughter to value
her impressive intellect and her strong body and her natural sweetness and
her loud voice and her fluffy hair, and I show her that shrinking and giving a
fuck about the opinions of people who wish her harm is neither healthy nor
natural.
So why the “maybe”? I figure we’re losing the game when we assume
we have it beat, so I’m ever-vigilant, lest a fuck creep into my pocket.

## SEVEN

## SHOW THEM WHO WE ARE

While much attention is paid to gaps and beefs between generations of activists, we know that respecting and learning from our elders is a key
tenet of Black survival. Many of our activists, culture-makers, and writers
of today have mentors who helped them make sense of history and taught
them tactics. We see this cross-generational love in slogans such as “Assata
taught me,” slang such as “the OG,” and our propensity for shouting out
everybody who came before us in award speeches.
But more than that, we inherited what seems to be a biological
propensity to demand more. More rights. More dignity. More humanity.
More freedom. You know, the little things. So we fight, building on the
work of those who came before to gain more secure footing for those who
will come after. Via interviews with Harry and Gina Belafonte and TaNehisi Coates, a note from former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal, a
strategy for resistance inspired by Muhammad Ali, and more, “Show Them
Who We Are” explores how cross-generational activism and knowledgesharing propels our fight.
Harry and Gina Belafonte on Art as a Change Agent and Legacy

## as a Road Map

      To call Harry Belafonte an icon is to tell the truth. The Emmy, Grammy,
and Tony Award–winning singer and actor crafted a legendary career that
most can only dream about. But it is his commitment to racial justice that
truly sets him apart as he leverages his platform—and his wallet—to be, as
his friend Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once called him, “a key
ingredient to the global struggle for freedom and a powerful tactical weapon
in the Civil Rights Movement here in America.” From creating the spark
that became “We Are the World,” to pushing for the end of apartheid in
South Africa, to working as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, Harry
Belafonte has devoted his life to making the world a more just place for
Black people.
      His work continues via Sankofa.org, the social justice nonprofit he
founded with the mission to “elevate the voices of the disenfranchised and
promote justice, peace, and equality.” One of his three daughters, producer
and actress Gina Belafonte, serves as codirector of the organization, where
she works every day to extend her father’s legacy and use art to break new
ground in the fight for racial equity.
      Here, Kenrya and Akiba settle in for a conversation with Gina and Mr.
B, as the ninety-two-year-old is called, about the role that art plays in
activism, the importance of building on the knowledge and work of our
ancestors, and what gives them hope in troubled times.
Gina, could you please describe what you do in one sentence?
GB: I’m an artivist.
Can you tell us what that means to you?
GB: I’m an artist who uses my craft and my artistry to create, support, and
develop social justice missions. As it relates to Sankofa.org, we’re a social
justice impact enterprise that’s in the business of increasing the power of the
arts as a core method to understand and challenge inequity. We work with
an incredible community of storytellers, activists, creators, and influencers
to amplify whatever is going on in our communities and create content to
shift the mainstream narrative to educate, to motivate, and to activate in
service of grassroots movements. Whether it’s a song, a piece of art, a play,
a film, a documentary, or a dance, we work to elevate our issues through the
arts and institutionalize the capacity of my father’s life and legacy.
Mr. B, what do you see as the difference between what being an
activist meant when you were coming up versus now? Do you
see the need for a shift in tactics between generations?
HB: Yeah, because I don’t think people are distracted with getting the right
to vote. That’s taken off the table. But the things that we’ve acquired have
left a large menu of things that still need to be done. Right now, we
primarily need to hear from women, to follow what women are setting forth
as the agenda for how to deal with the issues that face the human family.
And not just about gender; women are mothers, women are workers, women
are participants in almost all levels of human endeavor, and they face
discrimination in all of those areas. Women have got to seize the initiative
—as they are doing—to change the agenda.
Awesome. Gina, can you please tell us a bit about how you
formed your activist self?
GB: Well, I was conceived and born in activism. It’s been integrated in my
life, it’s part of my generational legacy. I was at marches, strategy meetings,
organizing meetings, community rallies, so it’s just a part of my DNA. Over
time, as I was introduced to many different movements and saw the plight of
suffering around the world, I garnered a sensitivity to the human condition.
In particular, I was introduced to a young man by the name of Bo Taylor
who titled himself as a gang interventionist. He was the facilitator of a life
management skills course that dealt with anger management and early
childhood conditioning. He worked this program in and out of correctional
facilities, and I had the good fortune to meet him and take the course that he
facilitated. My classmates and I graduated at the same time as a class of
incarcerated brothers, so we chose to graduate together. Seeing the way Bo
viewed and interacted with the men and women who were caught up in the
system inspired me to work with him. He knew that it was important to
elevate their voices and support them when they returned home. That was
maybe twenty-five years ago, and I’ve been a prison abolitionist in service
of dismantling the criminal justice system ever since.
Mr. B., we’ve seen a lot of articles about how you’ve worked with
artists like Jesse Williams and Zendaya. We’re really interested
in why it’s personally important to you to train the next
generation of racial justice activists.
HB: It’s important to me because I am a victim of those inequities. I mean,
I am African American, I am Black, I’m in America, I’m in a society that is
quite punitive to people of color, not just Blacks but Native Americans and
people of Hispanic descent. There are a lot of inequities, and the specifics of
our campaigns were really based on the laws of the state that were severely
punitive and unjust and denied us our human rights. We successfully
engaged aspects of those denials, but we did not achieve everything. I think
this present generation has a responsibility to not only sustain the victories
that we gained, but also to add to them.
You’ve talked a lot about gender, Mr. B, and that’s actually
something that makes us hopeful. We are wondering what
makes you hopeful right now.
HB: Oh, what makes you think I’m hopeful?
Well, sometimes that’s all we have.
HB: It’s like asking a drowning man, “Can you swim?” I’m not too sure
that I’ve had that much to be hopeful about. On the issues of race, I think
our moral space is terribly contaminated. I think America has lost its moral
compass, if it ever had one. It was conceived in violence, and it still
perpetuates a great deal of violence on us. When you see what’s happening
in all of the cities where there has been racial tension, when you see all the
places in which policemen have taken open season on Black men and the
cruel application of the law to Black people, there’s a lot to be done. Men
have a role to play, but I think women have to become the leaders of how to
handle the challenge.
Is there anything that makes you feel hopeful, Gina?
GB: Similarly to my dad, I find that we’re in a very depressed space and
moment. I think we’re in a state of shock and in trauma, as a country. I think
our trauma is multigenerational and it’s just coming a little bit more to the
fore. I think that in some ways, consciously or not, it’s even by design that
we’re in this feeling of impotence. But at the same time, I feel there is a
resurgence of a movement and a tempo and a reclamation wanting to make a
shift. I think that we’re seeing that in spurts, and I’m hopeful that within the
next few years we will come together as a large, unified movement. My
daughter and her generation make me hopeful that they will not play the
same kind of ego games that past generations have fallen to.
So, Mr. B, over the years of being involved in movements, have
there been personal or professional costs that you’ve paid?
HB: I don’t know that I paid a price. I think there’s a price that Black
people pay before we meet the challenge of ending racism, and in meeting
it, we minimize the cruelty of it. I faced the challenges with all the tools that
were at my disposal, I successfully met them and moved on with my life and
my career, dealing with all the obstacles that were put before me. In the final
analysis, I have survived all the challenges, I have made some contribution
to the progress that people of color have made against racism, and I’ve
made some progress on the issues of peace in times of war and struggle. As
a matter of fact, the consequence of my behavior has been most rewarding.
What does freedom for Black people look like to you?
GB: Well, I think there’s multiple ways of answering that question because
we have such a sordid history. I think freedom for Black people right now is
for our country and our world to claim accountability around the egregious
violations committed for centuries—since even before Christ—against
people of color because of greed. I think that we are a nation that has
systemically criminalized people of color in poverty, and I think freedom
and liberation will look like those who are oppressors being able to call a
thing a thing. They need to become accountable and find truly healthy and
loving ways for us to come together for a greater healing and a greater good.
What do you want your legacy to be?
GB: I want my daughter to think I was a good mother. I would also like my
legacy to be that I continued legacy, whether it was my own or that of those
ancestors who came before us in struggle who tried to find a better way for
us.
HB: Really, I have no desire for my legacy. I don’t think that very long after
I have passed away there will even be a memory that I existed. I have no
idea who the great leaders were in the dawning of slavery, though surely
there were a lot of people who should have been recognized and made
indelible in our nation’s history. But we haven’t done that, in part because
we’re denied our space in reality as a people, as a people in struggle, as
people who have rights. And that problem is constant because inequities in
this nation are constant.
GB: One of the things that I frequently speak about is that we have to, as
cultural organizers, affirm the importance of creativity. Creativity is the
cornerstone of our liberation; the arts open hearts and minds in ways that
straight-up speeches and textbooks cannot. While my father is not
concerned so much about his legacy, I am, because I feel that his legacy is a
road map and a tool for us to organize. To look at a life such as his is to not
only see that one man can make a difference, but to appreciate the way he
made a difference: by bringing many people together.

## Philadelphia Police Officer

      How do you spell resistance? B-L-A-C-K.
From the first captive arrival of Africans upon these North American
shores to the present, the very essence of being a Black person in America
has meant being in a perpetual state of resistance. There were as many
forms of resistance as the imagination provided, and acclaimed twentiethcentury historian Herbert Aptheker argued that there were at least 250 slave
revolts in the North American territory that we today call the United States.
Aptheker’s 1943 masterwork, American Negro Slave Revolts, broke new
ground in American history by telling great tales of resistance that were
regarded as in poor taste by respected guild historians.
And the resistance goes on, driven by the exigencies of lives lived under
a base oppression. In speech, song, dance, dress, naming, religion, and even
in cuisine, we continue to find the resonance of resistance, the frisson of
Black identity that reveals the resilience of Africanity in Black life in
America.
A Path to Black Healing: Cultural Understanding, Mentorship,
and the Building of Independent Black Institutions

## Haki R. Madhubuti

## Framing the Problem

In my short tenure on this earth—seventy-six years—I have experienced
the seen and the unseen, the known and the unknown. My people and I have
gone through the gates of other people’s definitions, imaginations,
incarcerations, provocations: enslavement, radical European acculturation,
negro, nigga, coon, colored people, Black, YellowBlack, Afro-American,
Africans in America, African American, and beyond.
If this is confusing, remember that these are the results of White
people’s ideas of the nation they built for themselves on the backs of
Indigenous and African people and poor White people who have bought
into the fiction of White supremacy.
This number includes the millions of African people stolen from their
homes, transported thousands of miles in horrid conditions, separated from
their families, auctioned and sold off, worked to death, raped, lynched,
terrorized, killed for literacy, entrepreneurship, and organizing, redlined,
and unfairly incarcerated. All of this is very basic, but not often truthfully
taught or discussed nationally.
Within this context, the personal has always been political for Black
people in America, whether we as individuals acknowledge it or not. Deep
cultural ignorance has been among our primary enemies. If you do not
know who you are with certainty, vision, and mission, anybody can and will
name you.

## Framing a Solution

My life changed measurably when I was nineteen and Africa-cultured
mentors came into my life. In all, there were six people in the 1960s who
took me in, often including me as an extension of their families. They were:
     Margaret and Charlie Burroughs, cofounders of the DuSable Museum
     of African American History
     Dudley Randall, founder of Broadside Press
     Hoyt W. Fuller, managing editor of Negro Digest, which became Black
     World magazine
     Barbara Ann Sizemore, first Black head of the Washington, DC, public
     school system
     Gwendolyn Brooks, master poet and the first Black person to win the
     Pulitzer Prize
And although he never mentored me directly, Malcolm X should be
included because, by the early ’60s, the philosophy of Blackness he
articulated gave me a Black fighting voice and consciousness. Likewise,
Martin Luther King Jr., by way of Marcus Garvey, Richard Wright, W. E. B.
Du Bois, Paul Robeson, and Langston Hughes, will always be foundational
in my maturation.
When you seriously measure the development of the success of nations,
what universally grabs your attention is the existence of first-rate institutions
beyond the family. These institutional structures are educational, business
and industry, medical, think tanks (both public and private), and fraternal
institutions, among others.
The critical vacuum nationwide that is seldom, if ever, contemplated is
the limited number of independent Black institutions (IBIs) functioning
positively at every level of Black survival and development. I define an IBI
as (1) self-sufficient (primarily receiving monies, aid, and inspiration from
its founders) and (2) Black, always with a capital “B” (defining a people’s
color, culture, consciousness, and location).
IBIs are geared toward solving the problems facing Black people. They
supply the people they serve with a sense of identity and answer the
questions: Why do we exist? How did we get to this land? What is our
liberation narrative?
Critical to building successful IBIs is the adoption of a philosophy of
African-centeredness that draws on values, bonding traditions, and
enlightened attitudes from all of Africa. It is absolutely necessary that our
people understand the current struggles and successes of the multiple
nations in Africa, so that we don’t duplicate the worst of any culture.
I, along with my wife, Dr. Carol D. Lee, and many others who helped to
build several institutions in Chicago, have visited multiple African nations.
We believe that to be African-centered means to create a philosophical
operating worldview from our collective experiences as African people, one
that is universal, and one that should be shared with our children. I believe
that all mentoring and educational programs targeting Black youth will fall
short of their mission if they don’t employ curricula deeply rooted in the
culture, history, politics, financial realities, and psychology of people of
African ancestry.
I know firsthand that this approach works, because we made it happen
through the schools I cofounded with a collective of young activists and
educators starting in the 1970s. We began with two storefronts on the South
Side of Chicago that expanded upon the location of Third World Press
(which I founded in 1967) and the Institute of Positive Education (which I
cofounded in 1969). We began servicing local young people after school
and on the weekend. These were our first liberation schools and the
foundation for work we continue to do to this day.
I believe that the traditional American educational experience has failed
our people. We have been reacting to the destructive and deadly forces of
White world supremacy for hundreds of years. But it is long past the time
for reaction; we must be proactive in our own best interest. Our fight begins
with ownership of self. People who are in control of their own cultural,
financial, political, educational, landmass, and military imperatives are
concerned with the healthy version of themselves and, most importantly,
their children.

Writer and Brand Strategist Kierna Mayo on How Her
Connection to Our Ancestors Informs Her War Against White

## Supremacy

I fight White supremacy by consciously loving exactly what it instructs
us to hate about ourselves. I admit that I keep in my mind a romantic notion
of an essential Blackness—and I use it as armor. As a Black person in the
world, as a woman, I feel consigned to fight with everything against the lie
of White supremacy, and just plain ole surviving is half of that battle. So I
live. My warrior visions (because we are at war) of us as a people
metaphysically connected to our ancestors, moved by the drum, and
naturally super-brilliant are informed by my actual Black experience. My
resistance comes through those pillars. The bedrock of White supremacy is
a simple idea taught to children all around the globe: White people are fully
human and the rest of us are not. Well, I have resisted that lie since
childhood in myriad ways—from rocking my beloved brown baby dolls to
creating entire spaces for Black storytelling as an adult professional. Today,
as a mother, above all in the fight against White supremacy, I bequeath that
guiding spirit of “fuck your lies” to my young. To resist isn’t optional in my
mind, it is to declare our humanity, and it may be all we got.
A Muhammad Ali–Inspired Strategy for Fighting White

## Supremacy

## Shawn Dove

When imagining and executing a strategy for successfully fighting White
supremacy, I first acknowledge that we are engaged in a centuries-long fight,
and then I immediately think of the best Black fighter who ever lived: my
first hero, Muhammad Ali. Fifty years ago, at the time of Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.’s assassination, the poetic pugilist was completing the first
year of a three-year exile and ban from boxing because he refused to enlist
in the United States military to fight in the Vietnam War. While I was first
drawn to the charismatic glow of Ali because of his floating and stinging
exploits in the boxing ring, I came to truly love him when I learned more
about his assertions and acts of Black love, unity, and defiance.
Since 2011, the Campaign for Black Male Achievement (CBMA) has
organized and facilitated an annual intergenerational gathering at the
Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky, called Rumble Young Man,
Rumble (RYMR), where leaders gather for renewal, healing, and the
exchange of best practices to engage in their collective fight to improve the
life outcomes of Black men and boys in America.
In our partnership with the Muhammad Ali Center, we incorporate the
six core life principles of The Champ into the curriculum for RYMR
gatherings across the country. Those principles—confidence, conviction,
dedication, giving, respect, spirituality—provide Rumblers with a
framework for leadership development. I believe they can also help us fight
White supremacy.
Confidence. Ali won many of his fights before he even stepped into the
ring, as he brazenly declared exactly which round his opponent would fall.
Why is confidence so important? In his book Brainwashed: Challenging the
Myth of Black Inferiority, advertising icon Thomas Burrell writes that since
slavery, White supremacists have designed and executed the most successful
marketing campaign in history by convincing Black people to buy into a
product called Black Inferiority, which has been perfected through four
centuries of propaganda, policies, and practices where “Blacks were
programmatically stripped of their cultural identity and brainwashed into a
mindset of Black inferiority.” A strong cultural identity and belief in the
humanity of Black people is the first telling blow to White supremacy. It
counters the pervasive mind-set that we are deserving of less than others,
the lie that our humanity is on a lower level than White people’s.
Conviction. Fighting White supremacy requires “a firm belief that gives
one the courage to stand behind that belief, despite pressure to do
otherwise,” as our curriculum outlines. We must acknowledge that we are
the dreams of our ancestors and that our fight will require a long view and
the ability to bounce back from one painful setback after another.
Many people say that the most iconic photograph of Muhammad Ali is
the picture of him standing victoriously over a prone Sonny Liston in the
first round of their 1965 rematch. However, for me, the most iconic picture
is one of him falling to the canvas after taking a vicious left hook to the jaw
from Joe Frazier in their first fight, in March 1971. This was Ali’s third bout
after returning to the ring. He could have easily stayed on the canvas after
Frazier’s powerful punch. After all, it was the last round of a grueling
fifteen-round brawl. But his conviction to rise up is what we must embrace
and embody in the fight against White supremacy, because we will continue
to absorb debilitating blows that will make us want to quit. Only with
conviction will we succeed.
Dedication. The battle we’re in requires “the act of devoting all of one’s
energy, effort, and abilities to a certain task,” as the Muhammad Ali Center
boasts on its walls. Folks like to elevate the bright-light moments of
victories, whether in the ring, on the front lines, or in front-page photo ops.
But dedication is not about the big splashy moments; it’s about the quiet
ripples of preparation and hard work before and after you jump in.
Ali always wondered why the press never talked about his supreme
commitment to roadwork and preparation before his bouts. He said, “I hated
every minute of training, but I said, ‘Don’t quit, suffer now, and live the rest
of your life as a champion.’” Winning the fight of our lives requires us to
mirror this dedication.
Giving. In the RYMR leadership guide, Dr. Torie Weiston-Serdan,
author of Critical Mentoring: A Practical Guide, says, “Muhammad Ali
showed us that giving, even at the point of personal sacrifice, is an
investment in our community’s legacy.” In magnifying this core principle,
she reminds us that the fight will require personal sacrifice and resources—
big resources to fight a well-resourced opponent in structural racism that
keeps the feet of White supremacy firmly planted in the center of the ring.
We have to transform the immense buying power of Black people in
America into immense battling power. We must give to candidates for
elected office who will leverage their legislative power to destroy racist
policies; we must give to organizations that are fighting the battle on the
front lines; we must give to people and institutions that nurture the next
generation of leaders. The power of Black philanthropy must be multiplied
for us to secure the fuel to keep fighting.
Respect. The Muhammad Ali core principle of respect demands “esteem
for, or a sense of the worth or excellence of, oneself and others.” In our
battle against White supremacy, we will need to embrace an intersectional
approach to winning that embraces the fights of Black women, Native
Americans, the LGBTQ community, and other groups who are battling the
oppressive forces of White supremacy.
In Freedom Is a Constant Struggle, Angela Y. Davis reminds us that
“new organizations such as Black Lives Matter, Dream Defenders, Black
Youth Project 100, Justice League NYC, and We Charge Genocide are a few
of the new generation organizations that have developed new models of
leadership and that acknowledge how important Black feminist insights are
to the development of viable twenty-first century radical Black movements.”
Davis highlights the urgency of leaders, especially old-school leaders born
in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement, to respect young leaders and the
strategic ways they show up for the fight.
Spirituality. Finally, the fight against White supremacy will require an
unrelenting faith in God and the sense of divine connectedness and timing
that this faith provides us. Ali described spirituality as “a sense of awe,
reverence, and inner peace inspired by a connection to all of creation and/or
that which is greater than oneself.” It will take spiritual fortitude—followed
by focused, strategic action—to win the fight against White supremacy.
Prayer, meditation, and self-care are essential spiritual practices of self-love.
Muhammad Ali provided us with a set of core principles. It’s up to us to
get in the ring and remember what The Champ said: “He who is not
courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.”

Ta-Nehisi Coates on the Importance of Mentorship and Making

## Sure Black People Know We Are Not Crazy

Baltimore native Ta-Nehisi Coates is one of the nation’s most celebrated
Black writers. In 2009, he published his first book, a hip-hop generation
memoir titled The Beautiful Struggle: A Father, Two Sons, and an Unlikely
Road to Manhood, about growing up in the Black nationalist household of
the book publisher Paul Coates. Ta-Nehisi Coates’s 2015 letter to his son,
Between the World and Me, garnered praise from Toni Morrison, a National
Book Award, and a MacArthur Fellowship. After the surprising election of
45, Coates released an essay collection titled We Were Eight Years in Power:
An American Tragedy.
At the time of this interview with Akiba, he was finishing up his next
book and emerging from a period of general wariness. Here they discuss
what makes a good mentor and why so many veteran Black feminist writers
are nice to him.
Let’s talk about who has mentored you and how they did it in
tangible and intangible ways.
Early on, my biggest mentor was [the late] David Carr [of Washington
City Paper]. He was capable of giving incredibly blunt opinions and
assessments. But at the same time, he fought for me. Because he was so
direct, when he said good things and displayed confidence in me, I really
believed him. That was crucial.
In my life right now, I’ve been blessed by a number of Black women
who have really stepped up. And I’m not saying that in a really corny or
sentimental way. I mean it’s literally true. I’ve had the luxury of spending
time with Sonia Sanchez. I’ve had Nell Painter really, really look out for me.
I don’t know if this is mentorship, but I know really if not for Toni
Morrison, my life would not be as it is right now. Jamaica Kincaid has been
supportive. I’ve never met her; we have this email relationship where she
checks in at least once a year. I really treasure that because she started doing
it at a time when I wasn’t sure what was going to happen. She was talking
about The Beautiful Struggle and how she was going to give it to her son. It
was really early. But I don’t know why all these Black women are willing to
mentor me. I haven’t had that relationship with the brothers. I have plenty of
male friends, Black male friends. But in terms of elders, the relationships
have been a little different.
Do you sense that it hasn’t been the same for men because of
feelings of competition?
I don’t know. I’m gonna throw something out here, and I don’t know if
this is true, Akiba. I really, really don’t. But with so much of the stuff that’s
come out with #MeToo, I wonder if in some of the brothers’ minds, part of
being a writer with some fame is having access to women. I don’t have a
problem with you printing that, but I just want to be clear that I’m still
working that out in my head. Because of how society’s set up, that women
who become more powerful [don’t] suddenly have more access to men in
the same way that men have access to women.
Can you break down what you think a mentor should be within
the context of White supremacy and Black folks?
It’s funny. I’ve talked to [the New York Times reporter and MacArthur
Fellow] Nikole Hannah-Jones quite a bit about this because she’s a lot better
at it than I am. I’m actually just getting this figured out. I literally have three
meals scheduled next week with younger writers just to talk to them. Up
until relatively recently, I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to support
myself writing, so I didn’t even really feel like I had much to offer anybody.
And then when I did find that I could support myself, I went through this
paranoid period. I didn’t trust anybody. It’s like, I’m careful about who I
talk to. And now I’m coming out of that and I’m trying to get back to it and
just pay back some of the stuff that was given to me.
How did you start?
I’m trying to listen and to urge people. I think writing can be brutal and
can make you want to quit, but it’s important not to quit. I just try to serve
for people as David Carr served for me as a person who is both offering
unadulterated honesty, but at the same time love and support.
The part of your question about White supremacy is interesting. None of
the people I’m seeing next week are White. I don’t have anything specific
against taking on younger writers who are White. But for obvious reasons,
I’m attracted to Black writers and other writers of color.
So you said that you’ve been talking to Nikole about mentorship
a lot. What specifically have you learned from her about it?
She is just so trusting in people. Nikole can have twenty young writers of
color, young Black writers over at her house, and she’ll just talk to them. I
guess I’ve learned openness from her. And she’s not any different from me
in terms of having a period of time when she struggled. We’ve talked about
how she was thinking of going into PR and saying, “Fuck this, I’m done
with this journalism.”
     So it’s not like I’ve suffered some amount of trauma on the way up that
she didn’t suffer. But I will say that when Between the World and Me came
out, the sheer amount of attention it got made it unclear why some people
were talking to me. I didn’t know what their angle was. It was damn near…
like I thought I was back on the street looking at everybody like, “What’s up
with you?” She was one of the people who I would talk to, who very slowly
began to convince me to open it up a little bit and not be so damn paranoid.
You know?
I do know about paranoia! So how do you fight White
supremacy?
     Well, how I fight it is through my writing. One of the things I always say
is that there are the actual socioeconomic facts of racism and White
supremacy, and then there is the attempt to make it look like nothing’s
wrong, as though there is no White supremacy. So my fight is actually on
the second front—to outline it, to make it clear, to make sure that Black
folks do not feel like they’re crazy. That’s my job.

## QUESTION, ANSWERED

     It’s clear that many activists draw inspiration from generations past.
Here we explore the question: who inspires you?

## Kenrya

     Do you know how I spent my most productive, satisfying twenty minutes
of today? Sitting in my truck, illegally parked on the side of a busy street in
Washington, DC, with my hot-ass MacBook on my lap and my iPhone in
my hand waiting for the clock to tick over to 9:00 a.m. EST so I could enter
my Beyhive presale code and come up on tickets to see Beyoncé in concert
for the fourth time. So it’s understandable that the following playlist of the
songs that I blast when I need to be inspired to exercise, tell somebody what
they not gon’ do, or turn a microaggression into a real live conversation
about why White folks need to collect their people is heavy on the Bey.
## *
Fight yo’ mama (but don’t tell her I sent you—I respect my elders).

## Kenrya’s Bad Bitch Playlist

     Beyoncé, “Grown Woman”
Because sometimes you need a reminder of who you are.
     Lizzo, “Truth Hurts”
“I don’t play tag, bitch, I been it.” A word.
     Beyoncé, “Ego”
Key lyric: “Usually I’m humble / Right now I don’t choose.”
     Estelle, “Stronger Than You”
     Estelle sings this song while voicing Garnet, a character on my favorite
     cartoon, Steven Universe. Garnet is a “fusion,” a being made up of two
     women who love each other so much that they can’t bear to be apart,
     and every single time I hear her sing “I am made of love and it’s
     stronger than you,” I feel literal chills and the overwhelming desire to
     fuck shit up.
     Beyoncé, “Flawless Remix” (featuring Nicki Minaj)
     Because I do, I do wake up like this.
     Bone Crusher, “Never Scared (The Takeover Remix)”
     You can think I’m afraid if you want to, but I’m from Cleveland, my G.
     Beyoncé, “Run the World (Girls)”
     Bruh.
     Anything by Saa
My kid has been singing since she started talking, and my phone is full of
surreptitiously recorded audio of her belting out her favorite songs and her
original creations. Whether it’s her take on “Alexander Hamilton” or a
lounge-ready freestyle (seriously, lately she has been turning the old hymns
of the church and Disney classics into jazz standards while she showers),

her singing propels me.

But you can’t tell me that Saa and I aren’t fortifying our hearts and minds against the ravages of
White supremacy when we walk across the room like Naomi Campbell.

## EIGHT

## LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME ALONE

First of all, love is not all you need. It might have been enough for four White dudes from Liverpool, but for Black people living and dying amid
the wreckage of White supremacy, love is not life-sustaining.
L-O-V-E can’t stop the bullet of a police officer who believes a Black
boy playing on the swings outside a recreation center is a mortal threat.
There aren’t enough heart-eyed emoji in the world to make a racist Twitter
troll recognize the humanity that lies beneath skin painted the color of the
night sky. And if you’ve found a way to use compassion to protect our queer
fam, come holler at us.
But, honey, love feels goooooood. Whether it’s self-love, romantic love,
tenderness for those who share our DNA, care for the people who make up
our communities, or a fierce adoration for our race, love has a way of
buoying us, providing just enough lift to keep our heads above the roiling
sea as we swim toward better days.
Struggle without love burns you out. It makes you mean. It kills your
vibe. But when you add loving to the mix, alongside organizing and
educating and creating, you birth an enduring form of resistance that is
radical, expansive, and transformative at its core. The people highlighted in
this chapter—including an ethnographer, a beauty expert, and an R&B
singer—know that the answer to the question “Who do you love?” should

## always be “Us.”

## And a Hashtag Will Set Them Free

## Dr. Yaba Blay, as told to Kenrya Rankin

     The “click-clack” of braids and beads. The shuffle of little feet moving
through steps in unison. The Inauguration Day side eye that spoke for us all.

#ProfessionalBlackGirl moments are all around us, and Dr. Yaba Blay

means to point them out via her video series and social media campaign,
which celebrate the everyday magic of Black girls and women. As a
professor, researcher, and ethnographer, she uses personal and social
narratives to disrupt fundamental assumptions about cultures and identities.
As a cultural worker and producer, she uses images to inform
consciousness, incite dialogue, and inspire others to action. Here she gives
us a window into the genesis of Professional Black Girl and why it’s so
important to live into our joy.
“Professional Black Girl began as a hashtag in 2015. I started using it on
social media when I saw pictures and videos of little Black girls doing
something that I thought was extra Black. Extra Black girl. The things that I
knew in my spirit that nobody had to teach them, they were just doing. I
used the hashtag as a way to note like, okay, whatever she’s doing, she’s
doing it to professional levels.
     “The following year I moved to North Carolina. Every time one of my
girlfriends came to visit, we wound up taking field trips to one of the
biggest beauty supply stores I’ve ever been to in my life. We’d be in there
for hours. I mean they have clothes in there, they have shoes, they have hair
products, they have hair, a big old jewelry section. We’d try on wigs and
reminisce on products, opening bottles of Pink Oil Moisturizer and being
like, ‘Oh my God, remember that smell?’
     “I had this idea that I wanted to do a video series with nuanced
conversations about hair, with the beauty supply store as the foundation of
the conversation. In my mind, I was going to end each episode with a quick
segment called ‘Professional Black Girl.’ I started recording my friends, but
when I watched the footage, it looked like its own thing to me. And so it
came to be a web series.
“I had so much fun producing it. We really reverted back to the
innocence and joy that comes with girlhood. While I initially started using
the hashtag to specifically point to girls, my experience playing in the
beauty supply store with my friends made me realize that the project could
be used intentionally to capture the lightheartedness and simple joy of being
a Black girl and help girls see themselves as connected to Black women. I
think the language of ‘girl’ allows us to do that because, ultimately, when I
think of my identity and what makes me who I am, I’m still a Black girl at
heart.
“Much of my work focuses on identity, so I have lots of conversations
with us folks about the ways that we think about ourselves. Teaching at an
HBCU, I see some very well-intentioned Black administrators and faculty
members who think that we’re training the next generation of successful
Black ‘professionals.’ But I’m watching us train our students away from
themselves. Students have told me of instances where someone told them
that they need to straighten their hair, or told them that they need to lose
weight. They correct the ways they speak and how they dress. I get it, but
I’m also troubled by it.
“Just think about the impact. What does it feel like, what does it mean to
be looking at your reflection, somebody who looks like you, who’s in a
position that you aspire to be in, telling you that who you are and how you
are isn’t good enough? We need to create opportunities for our youth—and
for ourselves—to be okay with being ourselves. Look, I think our ability to
code-switch is beautiful. I don’t have any evidence, but I wonder if it is a
product of the experience of enslavement and colonization, this ability to act
a particular way, talk a particular way, be a particular way in certain folks’
presence, and then go home and be free. I think it’s a skill and a talent.
“And I get it if we are teaching our youth how to do that well. But I don’t
think that’s what we’re doing. Instead, we’re teaching them not to be
themselves, and judging them when they are. So I want to live as an
example. There’s a freedom in being able to be whoever the hell I think I
am, despite, or possibly even because of, what anybody thinks or expects of
me.
     “Yaba is my investment. That’s who I’m invested in, for my happiness,
my joy, my ability to be myself. I think that—an investment in themselves—
is something we should be encouraging and supporting in our youth.
Because they’re going to have to deal with so much and fight so many
people in this world. The last person they should be fighting with is
themselves. And I think it’s important that we see examples, happy
examples, real examples of folks being able to navigate all these spaces
fluidly and still maintain themselves. And that’s what I aim to do with
Professional Black Girl.
     “That said, I’ve had a couple conversations with folks who have
questions about some of the content I post on the Professional Black Girl
Instagram account. They say things like, ‘Why are you elevating reality TV
folks?’ And my response is, ‘This is not a place for you to think.’ Come
have the joy, the laugh, then go about your business. If we can’t do that, then
we’re doing it wrong. For me, it’s always been important to reach as many
people as possible. That’s the point of Professional Black Girl: every one of
us has access to it, and every last one of us reflects it.
     “I always say that White supremacy is one hell of a drug. It did a number
on us. The ways in which we think about ourselves, the ways in which we
reflect upon ourselves, are no different, in many ways, than the ways that
they think about us and the ways that they reflect on us. We’re doing exactly
what they want us to do, to the point where you don’t even need White
people for White supremacy anymore. But these ways that we criticize
ourselves through their lens just aren’t real. So this type of imagery and
representation are crucial. We have to see ourselves differently, because if
we rely on the mainstream to show us ourselves, we will remain under the
foothold of White supremacy. Other people are going to think what they
want to think about your Blackness no matter what you present to the world,
so you might as well be free.
     “This idea of Black joy as a part of our liberation strategy is an honor to
our ancestors. Again, thinking about the period of enslavement and
colonization, none of us have any idea what that could have possibly been
like, right? But whatever it was they experienced, whatever it was they
endured, they still laughed. They still had families. They still danced. They
still sang songs. If they could do that, then—even though we feel like we are
in hell’s belly right now—we can still make time for joy.
“In this moment, I need it and I deserve it. And the response to
Professional Black Girl tells me that other people need it and deserve it
too.”
I fight White supremacy by being authentic in a field that is dominated
        by White males. White supremacy believes that only those who act
        and look like them are smart, but I make sure my difference reflects
    who I am in my dress, my personality, and my approach to problem-

Touching White Supremacy, Touching Beyond It (Strategy:

## Intimacy)

“The role of the artist is exactly the same as the role of the lover. If I love
you, I have to make you conscious of the things you can’t see.”—James

## Baldwin

I am the child of a Black father and a White mother. In spite of violent
racist conditioning, they saw home in each other across a college library in
the mid-’70s in South Carolina. They married three months later and, like
most couples, began creating a world, choosing what to keep from their
blood families and what to release. They kept a light, communal practice of
Christianity and an idea that family is a central focus of life.
They left almost everything else.
I was raised in an intimate home. By that I mean, love was explicit and
intentional. My parents knew each other, teased each other. They loved each
other, and they loved us. They were affectionate and aligned with each other.
We rarely saw them fight. They told us not to go to bed angry. Anger was
contained in the framework of punishment; once the punishment was
complete, the anger dissipated and we would continue with life, dinner,
homework.
      Sex with someone of another race, intimacy with the other, isn’t
necessarily an act against supremacy—part of the deep resentment against
light-skinned Blacks in this country is because we are a walking reminder
that so many people with the same racial makeup as me come from a
lineage of rape.
      But to truly love someone of another race, particularly in a dynamic
where one partner is White or has White-skinned privileges, can be a direct
act against White supremacy. To love someone and not need to take
anything from them or add anything to yourself, to be equals—that is how
my parents love. I would not call them radical in their politics, but they’re
definitely radical in love.
      To raise children in an environment where race does not make someone
more or less of anything, to raise children as equal to anyone they meet—
my parents built us a foundation from which it is very difficult to leap into a
framework of White supremacy. I think this was my parents’ intention; they
took us out of the country on purpose, certain that we would return to a
nation evolved. They wanted to give us a beginning of life different from the
stratified racial beginnings they had experienced.
      But my parents couldn’t see all the ways White supremacy had shaped
them, and I don’t remember them even talking about race until much later,
when it was explicitly being weaponized against us. When people asked us
what we were, we were free to come up with our own answers. My go-to
answer became, “What do you want me to be?” Precocious. But I realized
in elementary school that what people wanted was to feel comfortable, and
if I played with that, it gave me some power. Later, I layered in the
understanding that those who would ask me what I was, where I was from,
wanted to know where to place me in the construct of superiority and
inferiority in their minds.
      Children always learn the things adults can’t speak.
      I was in the seventh grade when I understood that the way my parents
loved, across the racial binary so central to the United States, was
exceptional. Up until then, my sisters and I were raised on military bases,
mostly in Germany, where a lot of couples and many of our friends were
multiracial, Black and German, Black and Japanese, Black and Italian.
It was a shock to move to Georgia, to go to a school that was a mix of
kids from the base and kids from the town of Hinesville, a school and a
community that was much more segregated than any place I’d ever been. I
learned the hard way that my flippant answers on race were never going to
make racists comfortable, or playfully uncomfortable. It was too free of me,
evidence of an agency they would not allow. To them I was not White, so I
was Black, and I was inferior. I was parts of a person, and the Black parts
were undesired. There was a new language of assumptions and insults to
learn, so comprehensive that it pushed the German words of my childhood
out of my mind.
It was a shock to be asked to pull myself into colored parts after a life of
experiential, if wishful, wholeness. I say wishful here to speak of what my
parents were up to. They truly believed that humans were slowly leaving
racism and White supremacy behind.
Racism waited for our return from Germany, waited with a violent
education, where it confronted us in school, on buses, and in Waffle Houses
and bubbled up in my extended family.
As I became more aware of racism, of Blackness and White supremacy,
I began to hear and be offended by things spoken casually by strangers, by
loved ones. I began to understand that racism had been in my life before, I
just hadn’t had the context to understand what was happening, what was
being said to me when someone complimented the texture of my hair, my
light skin.
It didn’t register to me because I knew White people, and I knew they
weren’t superior to anyone. Up close, it is impossible to believe in White
supremacy. Close to a real White person, there is humanity, the smell of
skin and the pinch of bones, the flatulence and eye crust, the dumb questions
and botched relationships, the beating heart and the beauty of animation,
that mysterious energy of life that does not discriminate. There is miracle
too. Magic. We all come from that mystery in the mud of stardust, and we
will all return to it with the shared scar of death.
I am friends with White people, beyond the unconditional love of my
mother. My White friends have in common that they are nonbelievers in
White supremacy. We can be friends, intimate and vulnerable, because they
know better and try to do better.
     Any system of supremacy is a system of distance: a commitment to stay
far enough away from each other that a mythology can be generated and
maintained, a mythology of being supreme, while others, due to some minor
difference in skin (or genitalia, class, desire, ability, birth place, familial
religion, etc.), are inferior. To assert superiority over another human being
means repressing or hiding the full reality of one’s own humanness, the
flaws and the chaos.
     As a life choice, White supremacy is a tragedy. To sacrifice being of a
wildly diverse species for the sake of a false supremacy is to step away from
the possibility of being truly known. It is isolation as socialization: it is
violent to teach children to hold themselves apart from others.
     We have been swimming in the waters of supremacy for most of human
existence, as if rivers could flow away from the sea, splitting themselves,
cleaving the multitudes into different territories.
     Perhaps God struck us different in this way to keep us from reaching
heaven, from realizing we are in heaven, on heaven. Togetherness can feel
divine.
     Perhaps, as Octavia Butler taught us, the essential flaw of our species is
intelligence combined with hierarchy, that we use our genius for the work of
separation and supremacy.
     White supremacy is a virus that distorts every lens of the mind, making
it impossible to see the vulnerable, mundane, same same same body.
Intimacy is about honesty with our flaws—White supremacy has to pretend
that White people have none.
     Authentic intimacy with the other is one of the ways we can remember
we are all bodies and break the curse of perfection embedded in the myth of
superiority.
     I also had to learn to be intimate with myself, to look at my skin and my
eyes, the shape of my body. To love my ass even though it wasn’t small and
flat like the ideal of the White girls around me. And then to love my ass
even though it wasn’t round at the top like the ideal of the Black girls in my
class. To learn that most people don’t have the ideal version of an ass or any
other part—we have reality, and reality is beautiful because it pulses with
life and desire and movement. I’ve learned to love my skin when it was
nearly translucent in the Northern winters, and when it was red brown in the
summer. To love my hair where it frizzes into a curly halo when I want it to
lay flat, and to love the parts that have straightened as I’ve aged. To love my
insatiable longing for a Black Power Afro. To learn that my body doesn’t
trend and doesn’t self-segregate. White people have a million kinds of
bodies, as do Black people. I had to learn that nothing in my body was
explicitly White or Black or superior or inferior. And that I didn’t have to
assert Blackness as superior to balance the trauma of White supremacy. I
just had to love myself whole. I am miracle, that’s all.
It feels radical to care for myself, to engage in the political warfare
Audre Lorde called me to. It also feels radical to experience pleasure in my
Black body, and with any body that is not White. And it feels radical to see
White people experience pleasure that isn’t about dominance.
I feel liberated by my desire for myself. I feel liberated in my desire for
those who look like me, and those Blacker than me. I feel liberated when I
feel intimacy with White people that doesn’t require either of us shrinking.
All of this allows me to be my whole self. Each experience of wholeness
makes it less possible to participate in segregation, within or without.
Intimacy allows the transformation we so desperately need, beyond
Whiteness as superiority.

Dr. Joy Harden Bradford Wants You to Be Vulnerable
Dr. Joy Harden Bradford is an Atlanta-based licensed psychologist, but
her work reaches women all over the world via her podcast, Therapy for
Black Girls. In the following interview, she talks to Kenrya about breaking
down the stigma surrounding mental health, why she almost exclusively
works with Black women, and the importance of seeking out spaces built
with Blackness in mind.
Why are you a psychologist?
I think most mental health professionals have a story about being the
person who friends turn to, and the same is true for me. It feels like a calling
to help people through difficult times, and to offer a listening ear and a place
to share difficult things.
Why do you choose to work pretty much exclusively with Black
women?
That’s what I feel is important. I think less than 5 percent of all mental
health professionals are of color, and if you drill that down to Black women,
it’s even smaller. My experience has been that Black women usually want a
Black woman therapist. It feels like it’s really important to me to be
available to do that work for us.
What led you to start Therapy for Black Girls?
I was watching Black Girls Rock! in 2014, and I felt so inspired. There
was an energy that you could feel through the TV screen. I thought, How
could I do something like this for mental health? What might give people
that same kind of vibe? I immediately jumped online to see if the domain
was available, and Therapy for Black Girls was born. It started as just blog
posts, and then I added the podcast in April 2016.
Why is this work important?
I think often there are things going on with us as women that we don’t
even recognize as a mental health issue. It’s really important for me to give
people everyday language for some of the stuff that we may be
experiencing. You know, mental health is definitely about anxiety and
depression and all of those things, but it’s also about setting boundaries,
knowing whether a friendship is healthy, and figuring out how to stop
people-pleasing. All of those things are important to your mental health, so
I want to help us have these discussions.
How does tackling our mental health tie into expanding our selflove?
     If we’re not taking care of ourselves, that’s an ultimate act of not loving
ourselves. Sometimes that’s because we don’t have the language, and we
don’t know how to love ourselves. But also, the idea of the Black
superwoman is not new. That is something that has been placed on us, to
always be the one who has to hold it together, and it’s just not feasible. Why
are we not allowed to be vulnerable and have moments of weakness and
need other people just like everybody else?
How does your work help Black women endure the ravages of
White supremacy?
     I think sometimes people don’t realize the impact of racism and just
constantly living in a system where you never know what the news is going
to be about the president, what new scandal is going to break, what
ridiculous law he will try to put forth. It really takes a toll. I try to help
listeners understand that their feelings are real and offer strategies for
managing the accompanying anxiety and depression.
Are there mental health benefits to being in spaces that are built
just for us?
     Oh, absolutely. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t have some challenges—
we’re not all alike, we’re human, we have different personalities—but I
think those challenges are far less than the ones that come with being in
spaces where you’re constantly having to ask yourself: Do these people
think I belong here? Am I making sense? Do they understand where I’m
coming from? That’s a large part of where the imposter syndrome comes in
for us. We don’t have to do as much second-guessing of ourselves in spaces
that are created just for us.
Are there any costs to building this movement around Black
people?
My clientele would be bigger if I didn’t target my services for Black
women, and I probably miss out on opportunities. But that doesn’t matter,
because I’ve been able to create something that’s really important to me.
I’ve heard some White therapists say that they don’t think it’s “fair” that I
prefer to see Black clients. My rebuttal is, “All other therapists can be for
everybody else. It’s okay for us to say that some stuff is just for us.” If this
allows more Black women to take their mental health more seriously, then
I’m fine with whatever kinds of criticism and feedback come my way from
other people.

## You Got the Juice Now, Man

## Aja Graydon

Aja Graydon and her husband, Fatin Dantzler, are Kindred the Family
Soul. The two singer-songwriters met in the late ’90s on the Philadelphia
neo-soul scene and married within a year. They went on to have six
children, release six critically acclaimed albums, and perform for thousands
all over the world. Aja and Fatin write about a range of real-life topics,
including the recession, making their kids do housework, White supremacy,
and materialism. But what they are best known for is their love. Here is
Aja’s take on being an example of an everyday pair of Black folks doing all
they can to stay together.
Dancing well requires many things—rhythm, coordination, musicality,
and memory.
Marriage is a dance.
There’s that initial spark of inspiration and those moments of pure joy—
then the real work begins. That means learning routines, perfecting them
with discipline, and accepting that a change in the style of the music can
land you at square one. That’s why I practice multiple styles of engaging
with my beloved and my children. This is what makes Kindred the Family
Soul the model Black couple—if marrying young and broke and having six
kids while trying to maintain a career in the music business is the goal.
Because we write so many songs about our love, we perform as a couple,
and people have seen our kids on the reality show we created, Six Is It, our
fans expect us to exemplify the perfectly intact, God-fearing family. They
want perfection because it gives them hope, and hope is essential to Black
survival.
To be honest, I’m ambivalent about this being our role in the struggle.
On the one hand, I know that a drama-free image can hamper us as artists.
On the other hand, who doesn’t want to be seen as the epitome of Black
love? But we aren’t the Huxtables set to music. In the beginning of our
relationship, we saw ourselves as a rebellious pair of young lovers. Now,
waking up together, year after twenty years, humbles us.
     People forget that we have written extensively about our imperfections
and our learning curves. And our years of working together, touring the
world, and connecting with other couples have opened my eyes to why it is
so uniquely challenging for Black people to love each other.
     For us, marriage sometimes mirrors the more critical work our
community requires. It’s great to say, “I love being Black,” but we have to
do the more intense work of loving ourselves and whoopin’ White
supremacy’s ass. This takes levels of trust, intimacy, and self-awareness that
are difficult to achieve because of our collective trauma. If you expect your
beloved to never hurt you deeply, that is naive. It’s what happens after
you’ve been hurt that determines the outcome. As a people, our victory over
trauma makes our love for one another extraordinary.
     No pressure, though.
     From the outside looking in, there is no way to tell who has the juice and
who doesn’t. There’s no way to say what will last or what won’t, so bravery
is the bottom line. Bravery isn’t as fun as the other qualities associated with
love. A couple of times we’ve almost failed, but we’ve lasted due to the
bravery that we inherited from our enslaved ancestors. They lived in the
very worst conditions and still loved each other.
     Like most acts of bravery, ours have been preceded by circumstances
that forced us into conference with our coping skills. We’ve had to learn to
ignore the echo of divorce statistics and of our parents’ failed marriages.
We’ve taught ourselves to relax and trust our instincts. We don’t fear losing
our relationship because we understand who we are and what we’re capable
of. And that, I think, is the true gift of our Black love. We know we are
connected by purpose and destiny. And we are lucky as f#@k.

## I fight White supremacy by telling our untold stories.

## On the Exhausting Notion of Guarding Our Beauty

## Ayana Byrd

It started with a boy.
I liked him. One day in the school lunchroom, I was talking to his best
friend, a White boy. He wanted to tell me a secret about my crush. If it were
a movie, it would have been the moment I leaned in closer to him, though I
remember I willed myself to look like whatever he had to say was no big
deal. But it was, because I really liked his best friend, who was Black and
who had just broken up with White, blond Laura. I made my expression as
neutral as I could. Tell me.
“So…” he said, dragging it out. “Chris said he would like you, if.”
If. He paused again.

## “If your body was on someone else’s face.”

As one of the only seventh-graders with breasts, liking my body was not
an act of original thought. But I understood the coded language his friend
used: Chris liked White girls, and my Black face was not attractive to him.
And he actually told a White boy this. I felt ugly and racially sold out, and I
needed to stand in a locked bathroom stall to have whatever moment I was
about to have alone.
Before I made it to the restroom, Chris walked up to me in the hallway,
oblivious to what had just happened. For the first time in my life, I had an
out-of-body experience. I heard a voice—my voice—in my head. It spoke
so clearly: “Don’t hit him.” Of course not, I thought. I had never hit anyone.
But then I watched my right hand move in a wide arc until it connected with
Chris’s left cheek, and I slapped what my grandmother would have called
“the mess” out of him.
Another example.

## “You sho’ is ugly.”

In the midst of the physical and sexual and emotional violence that is
inflicted on Celie in The Color Purple, she meets her husband-abuser’s
mistress. This cackling declaration of Celie’s unattractiveness is the first
thing Shug Avery says in both the book and film versions. The sentence has
become iconic in Black popular culture, five syllables that bring on an
immediate cringing shame. Celie instantly believes this pronouncement; her
entire life has taught her to believe in her own ugliness. But by the end of
the story, she is a homeowner, an entrepreneur, a woman who has
experienced sexual pleasure, and one who smiles and laughs freely. She is
beautiful.
      Both of these two stories—the fictional and the achingly real—include
acts of resistance. In one, literal physical resistance, the violent
consequences for someone who desired White beauty saying my Black face
should be swapped out.
      And in the other, survival and transformation were acts of resistance. “I
think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere
and don’t notice it,” Alice Walker writes in the novel, explaining that the
title is a call to arms, a reminder that everything is a creation of God and we
should love it accordingly. Celie is this color purple, ignored and neglected
her entire life. But when she recognizes the God in herself, she also finds
her beauty.
      I thought of both of these experiences as I struggled to write this essay
about White supremacy, Black resistance, and beauty. The struggle was
because of what felt like competing beliefs that couldn’t be reconciled.
      First, there is my belief that our culture’s beauty ideals are drenched in
the poison of White supremacy, idealizing straight hair, White skin, and
European features. Popular culture, mass media, curricula, and hiring
practices enforce the privilege that comes with White beauty. And, as Black
women, we are constantly in a position where we must push back if we are
to be seen properly. We declare in print, on social media, in teaching our
children, and in our daily lives that our hair, our lips, our noses, our brownskinned Blackness is beautiful and we are not less than.
      This is the resistance.
      And this is my other belief: feeling beautiful is not an act of resistance.
If we are the color purple, feeling beautiful is running through the field.
Open arms, wide hearts, in the sun. Feeling beautiful is carefree; resisting is
work.
Resistance also implies that there is another, a thing, idea, person, or
notion, to push back against. And when the acts of resistance are to assert
Black beauty in a White supremacist world, the other is Whiteness, centered
and ever-present. White women look like this—but we are this and that is
also beautiful. Light skin is considered the ideal—but our brown skin is also
beautiful. Experiencing our beauty as an “also” or a “but” is reductive.
It is also not true to how most Black women live. We constantly
experience our beauty in a way that does not reference Whiteness. When we
are feeling beautiful, it is a solo act, just us and our reflection. To bring it
back to popular culture, when Black women watched the 2018 film Black
Panther and the bald, braided, kinky-haired brown bodies on the screen, we
cheered the beauty and it had nothing to do with White people. The dazzle
of Wakanda was all ours.
Still, what I first saw as the struggle between these two beliefs is actually
a necessary progression. To get to the place of feeling beautiful, we must
first resist. That is because the path to owning our beauty is pocked with the
craters and dangers of White supremacy. The politics of beauty ensnares
even the most decidedly unpolitical. Every woman is told she is meant to be
beautiful, and she is told what that looks like. And capitalism pretends that
it is within our purchasing power to get there, through skin lighteners, hair
straighteners, gym memberships, and plastic surgery. And White supremacy
wants to forever remind Black women that we will never actually get there,
we will never be White, we will never be invited all the way into the gilded
hallways where the beautiful live and thrive.
For Black women, our resistance is to lean all the way into the mirror, so
close that we can almost touch the image we see reflected there. And to
stare and believe, “I love everything I see.” And then to share with another
Black woman how she can also experience that.
How do we get to this? How do we see and know beauty in the mirror
and in each other’s faces and bodies? What does this path to beauty look
like? It looks like books, documentaries, and talks that dismantle the
hegemony of these European ideals. It looks like studying the unsung
history of our hair, style, and beauty culture. It looks like the growing
number of Black women entrepreneurs like Jamyla Bennu, Jane Carter, and
Anu Prestonia who have used their love of Black hair and skin to begin
beauty businesses, diverting some of the billions of dollars we spend away
from multinational corporations and back into Black communities. It looks
like the phrase “Black is beautiful,” first used by abolitionist John Swett
Rock in 1858, that became the name of a consciousness movement in the
1960s.
This is the resistance. It is a fight that never ends. There will always be
another racist declaring that we are not beautiful, that we look like baboons
or gorillas—even when we are First Lady Michelle Obama. There are
always cultural appropriators called Bo Derek, Kim Kardashian, and all
those other White women we see every day playing dress-up in our beauty
and calling it something else.
This constant vigilance, this guarding of our beauty, can be exhausting.
And so, when I need to regroup, I turn to women like academic Yaba Blay
and photographer Delphine Fawundu who have dedicated their work to
tackling the space where beauty, Blackness, and White supremacy meet. I
watch the Black girls in my life when they are playing and spinning and
loving their beautiful selves. I find websites and Instagram accounts that are
saturated in images of Black skin and textured hair. I use them like water, to
stay hydrated in a world that wants us to be ugly and dry.
And I remember that telling us that we are ugly intends to cut to the
bone and hobble us in a way from which we are to never fully recover. “You
sho’ is ugly” is not just Celie’s denunciation. It is meant to be all of ours.
But it is four other words, “you sure are beautiful,” that act as our collective
call to arms.
Resistance is necessary to position us more firmly in a space where we
can see and love Black women’s beauty. But once we are in this space, the
resistance fades away to let in the euphoria of what we behold. This is the
payoff, and the prize looks like the brilliance of our brown bodies.

## QUESTION, ANSWERED

As we examine the importance of love in all its forms in the fight to
dismantle White supremacy, we consider the question: who do you love?

## Kenrya

Myself, finally. And can I tell you? That feels like a revolutionary act.
To be a White child born in America is to burst onto the scene filled with
love. It expands their lungs when they take their first breaths, flows into their
guts when they suckle, straightens their backs as they begin to understand
the space they occupy in the collective imagination. And because they are
born into a loving world, one filled with philia, or goodwill, loving
themselves requires little effort, and certainly no coercion from their
parents, no hurried pep talks about how their tightly curled hair is gorgeous
and unique before they walk into a school where the locks are mostly
straight, no tear-filled reassurances when they leave dance class upset
because someone laughed at their skirt that carries the intricate patterns and
vibrant colors of Nigeria, no serious talks about how, yes, some police
officers have shot dead little people who look just like them when they were
playing on a swing set just like this one.
Bullies may try to steal it for themselves, men might work overtime to
extract it from their female and femme peers, and the ravages of very real
personal trauma might push it to the back of their minds, but the moment
White people enter a space with someone whose identities fetch a lower
market rate, they are subconsciously reminded of who they are and what
they have been blessed with: an innate sense that because the world loves
them, having love for themselves, philautia, is a foregone conclusion, a
feeling they couldn’t escape if they wanted to.
Maybe there was a time, before I could understand the world around me,
when I felt that love. Back before I learned that much of the nation I was
born into was invested in a system that placed me at the bottom of the racial
hierarchy. But I know that it wasn’t long before self-love had to become
more than a feeling. If I was to thrive, it had to become an actual practice.
But learning to do it took many moons.
I’m not talking about self-care, though it has its place. I know that my
health depends on scheduling time in my day to sit and eat a meal without
simultaneously typing an email, on pouring lavender essential oil into the
tub from time to time so I can soak while I make the most of my Netflix
subscription. But, for me, seeing past the damage that the world has inflicted
on my self-esteem—via media that tell me that without white skin, blond
hair, and blue eyes, I am worthless; men who would act out the dredges of
patriarchy on my body and mind; a bloodline deeply scarred by colorism
that discouraged me from wearing bright colors because I was “too dark”—
requires actual work. Not the work of remembering who I was before I was
told that I was unlovable. Not the work of imagining a time in the future
where I feel the full weight of agape, Godly universal love, in my spirit. But
the work of manifesting a timeline where I can adore my whole self right
now.
Where I can grant myself permission to be still and breathe in the
warmth of my own company and know in my bones that it’s enough. Where
I don’t have to code-switch because if I deliver the ain’ts and gon’s that
reside on my tongue with the twang that seeped through the generations,
some White-aspiring person will think I’m uneducated and undeserving of
their respect. Where I expect people to both remember and pronounce my
Black-ass name correctly because it is mine. Where I demand more from a
society that would begrudge me scraps and deem me uppity for still being
hungry. Where I remember that if I extinguish my light to comfort others, it
will only leave us all sitting in the dark.
And so I am embodying that love. Not just claiming it, but making it so,
overflowing with it and pouring it into the barren cups that surround me.
Because the only thing that can break a worn-out cycle is to invest in a new
one. Ase.

## Akiba

“Be Real Black for Me” has long been one of the most significant songs
in my world. The 1972 duet by Donny Hathaway and Roberta Flack does a
thing that none other does: it makes “Black” shorthand for being sweet,
reliable, vulnerable, honest, communicative, loyal, kind, and truly
committed to someone in a romantic relationship. “Be Real Black for Me”
is Tea Cake and Janie without the abuse. It’s Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee
without the fame. It’s my parents, who met via my mom picking up a
handsome hitcher from the city of Philadelphia bound for Cheyney State
University where they were both doing the super Black things of the time.
Lyrics I love from “Be Real Black for Me”: You don’t have to search and
roam / ’Cause I got your love at home / Be real Black for me.
This concept of Blackness-as-home has formed my own romantic
fantasies and the occasional debacle. Once, for a talent show in downtown
New York City, I had a friend make an original backing track of the song for
me that I could use again and again. I figured since “Be Real Black for Me”
had been sampled by M.O.P. for “World Famous” and Scarface for “My
Block,” the song would connect. I walked out onstage to hundreds of
Japanese faces, some framed by fake dreads. The song did not connect.
But more important than leading to a bad show was that this Blacknessas-love concept made cultural touchstones—like natural hair, shared
musical taste, a decent grasp of history and politics, African garb, yummysmelling oils, and a healthy, bushy beard—the evidence that a relationship
was sound and would last beyond the fun parts. That the blinding Whiteness
of the love that rules rom-coms is not the only way to a shared life.
So I was always falling in “love” with that dude with the waist-length
locs and big beard who called me some form of Kiba Biba and made beats.
In fairness to me, he fell for me too. But in place of real connection were
intense moments, quirks, and physical engagements that I took as sharing.
Extra props went to “conscious” dudes who were secure enough not to
use quasi-Black nationalism as a cover for their homophobia or sexism.
Once, one such gentleman, whom I was on and off with in an undefined
relationship for ten years, came home and announced that a gay man had
walked up to him that day as he sat outside for lunch and started talking to
him.
“Word?” I said, scared of what was going to fall out of his lips. “Then
what happened?”
“Nothing really,” he replied. “He seemed lonely. We talked about a
painting he was carrying. He was an artist. Then he kept it pushing.”
Mmmm.
That guy was so very sweet and absolutely noncommittal. He had keys
to the house and fed the cat when I was away despite the fact that feline thug
life once attacked his feet at the bottom of the bed. But real life intervened.
He didn’t finish college due to some abuse of his credit that he did not
inflict. He had never left home and didn’t talk about his family. He did
security at an art school where he should have been a student and then a
professor. He cared that he didn’t finish college but didn’t do anything about
it. I couldn’t decide if I cared about his lack of ambition or if I was just
worried that my own get-up-and-go would make him resent me.
The answer came after a very long break. I can’t remember how we
reentered each other’s lives, but he had since enrolled in school and was
more satisfied than I had ever seen him. We went to see an ’80s R&B maven
tear up a tourist trap downtown. It was one of our best times, which led to a
disjointed discussion about love in which I blurted out, “Of course I love

## you. What are you even talking about?”

“I never knew that!” he lied. “You never showed that. That time we
fought about money…”
Rather than hate him for acting confused on purpose, I locked him out of
my house, my phone, my head, my heart. Every surface is absent him.
There have been several more hims, before and after:
I loved him. He fucked a White prostitute and others in his travels.
This one threw a duffle bag full of pots at my head, punched a wall and
broke his hand, and told my mental health business to all of his messy
friends.
That one said he loved me too, when she was not around. But,
“revolution!”
I got ready to love him, but after many years of flirtation, he had twins
with a woman he never mentioned as more than a friend.
I still love one, but I believe that something died in him when he was little,
that someone touched him in the wrong way. He has never come out and
said it, instead leaving crumbs in jeans pockets, dropping hints like loose
change. “That jawn is a sociopath,” said my married-with-kids sister Asali.
But I can love him because the idea of his touch now seems inanimate. We
laugh like kids. I say, “Please take care of yourself,” and mean it.
Most recently, I wasn’t in love with, but was relieved by a him. I was finally
claimed and claiming! He knew about my anger, my bad luck, my bursts of
unavailability, my corniest notions of what a lasting relationship should be.
We talked all day on text. (Emojis as adults are fun. Don’t front.) We talked
about a future and our mistakes. Private jokes were key, as was our shared
idea of what Blackness meant. He was a protector, someone who would get
into a fight on the street with a man laying hands on a woman. He was a
traditionalist who got a kick out of my Black feminism. “Be Real Black for
Me” it was, until he asked me for some small, strange sum of money. I
asked him something that my gut knew would end it: “What’s it for?” He
bounced with an attempted lecture that was very far below both of us.
But it’s okay. Not a ten-year entanglement or a forever wound. Progress.
Donny Hathaway plunged to his death in 1979. My parents have been
married for forty-eight years. These two facts are as unrelated as “Be Real
Black for Me” is to a reality beyond exceptional songcraft and a very groovy
first dance for folks with surprising taste. Yet the song stays on my playlist
for nostalgia’s sake. I still enjoy fantasizing that a beard is a viable symbol
of longevity and that sweetness will move throughout our bodies, reviving
every dead or dying piece of psychic tissue until we become something real
and whole together. Yes, I still do this knowing full well that the best that
could happen is me being real Black for myself.

## I MAKE MONEY MOVES

There’s no other way to put this: on a scale from “pitiful” to “killing it,” the state of Black wealth is firmly at “pitiful.” As it turns out, decades upon
decades of slavery, Jim Crow, redlining, land theft, mass incarceration,
predatory lending, education discrimination, gentrification,
deindustrialization, and zero reparations really have done a number on how
much we have to live on and pass down to our kids. A 2016 study from the
Institute for Policy Studies and the Corporation for Economic Development
found that it would take 228 years for the average Black family to amass the
same level of wealth the average White family holds today. Even when we
## *
are born wealthy, this nation is designed to bring us down: A 2018 study
from researchers at the US Census Bureau, Stanford University, and
Harvard University showed that Black boys raised in the nation’s wealthiest
families are more likely than their White counterparts to live in poverty
when they reach adulthood; the study points to racism as the reason.
And yet we keep pushing, using our considerable skills to crack open the
door to collective prosperity with a heart. Black women are the fastestgrowing group of entrepreneurs in the United States. We’re out here
building our own tables, creating platforms where our art can thrive, using
money to directly attack a system that uses poverty as an excuse to lock us
away, and marshaling our resources to demolish a supposed representative
democracy that works only for those who are able to grease the wheels with
cash.
From the streaming service CEO, to the couple fund-raising for
progressive Black political candidates, to the folks using technology to bail
Black people out of jail, “I Make Money Moves” holds up the fam who are
working hard to build Black income, wealth, and culture, for all our sakes.
DeShuna Spencer on Eradicating Black Unemployment One

## Stream at a Time

DeShuna Spencer is the founder and CEO of kweliTV, a video streaming
service that curates independent films, documentaries, web series, and
children’s programming from the entire African Diaspora. A master brand
evangelist, she has secured six figures’ worth of funding via pitch and grant
competitions alone, winning over judges from the National Black Chamber
of Commerce and the Harvard Africa Business Club alike. In this interview,
DeShuna, a native of Memphis, Tennessee, talks to Kenrya about the joys
and pains of fund-raising while unapologetically Black, why truth reigns
supreme in storytelling, and how streaming will set us free.
Tell me kweliTV’s origin story.
The idea came to me as I was watching television in 2012. Back then I
had cable, and I was flipping, flipping, flipping, and couldn’t find anything
that I wanted to see. So I cut cable and got Netflix, hoping that I would see
more diverse content there. And while they had some, it was the same
romantic comedies and throwback movies. I love the Black movies from the
’90s, but how many times can you watch Juice?
Meanwhile, I follow all these blogs, and they write about great
independent films that screen at festivals, but I couldn’t find them. I realized
that once these Black films finish the festival circuit, they have nowhere to
go if they don’t have a big name behind them. I was crazy enough to say,

## “I’m going to create a place for them to go!”

How did you get started?
I entered a pitch competition, where they didn’t pick me because they
weren’t sure about the future of streaming! But in 2014, I won $20,000 in
the Unity Journalists for Diversity New U competition. We used that money
to build our beta version of the service, which allowed us to do further
testing to see if people actually cared about what we were doing and would
pay to subscribe. Then it took two years to get out of beta. That’s a book
within itself, the challenges of bootstrapping the company. I had no idea that
Black women only get 0.2 percent of all venture capital investments until I
was looking and saying, “Where’s the money?” and people were saying,
“Good luck with that.” Technically, we’re still a startup company, we’re not
fully funded. I’m doing this off blessings, holding it together with tears,
bubble gum, and glue.
Why is kweliTV important?
It’s about owning our stories. It’s one thing to say, “Yeah, you know,
we’re getting our foot in the door from mainstream spaces like HBO and
Netflix.” But there’s also something to be said for something that we own
personally, where we control our narrative and don’t have to dilute our
voices, dilute our culture, for a mainstream, colloquial audience. kweliTV is
unapologetically Black. I think that us being authentic is relevant for no
matter who watches the content.
Another thing is the global aspect of it. When I tell people we’re focused
on the Black global community, or the African Diaspora, most people tend
to just think African Americans. They tend to forget that we’re basically
everywhere—the Caribbean, Europe, Latin America. My goal is to show
our stories from all over the world in a way that’s not monopolistic or
stereotypical. I see kweliTV as an avenue to share the Black experience no
matter where you are.
What does “kweli” mean?
Kweli means “truth” in Swahili. And our mission is to curate content
that is a true representation of the Black experience. It doesn’t always have
to be positive, it doesn’t have to be feel-good—just true. There are realities
in our community that we may not necessarily like, but it’s okay to tell those
stories here.
How does exposing that truth help us resist White supremacy’s
pull?
By dispelling some of the myths we see in mainstream media. I
remember when Trump ran for office, he was like, “What do you have to
lose? You get shot when you walk outside.…” He was basically saying that
we’re all poor, we’re all dumb, we’re all going to be killed. He assigned that
narrative to all Black people in one swoop. And he’s not the only one. There
was a study that came out about media and implicit bias, and it showed that
Black people are swallowing the negative imagery we’re being fed. Will
kweliTV solve White supremacy? Not totally, no. But there comes a point
where we just cannot be afraid of being who we truly are. For those who are
actually open to learning about Black culture without blinders and filters
about what they think it is, we can definitely challenge stereotypes and help
them get there so we can see our full selves.
What has been your biggest unexpected challenge in running
kweliTV?
When people ask about my exit strategy. When you have investors, they
want to make a return within five years. Having an exit strategy essentially
means selling your company to a Netflix or some other company that’s not
Black-owned. And if we want to continue to be a Black-owned company,
then we may not be able to take advantage of all the possible investment
opportunities. I get emails from people saying, “Don’t become BET,” which
means, “Don’t sell out.” But how do you reconcile that desire with the fact
that one day you’re going to have to sell it? That’s something I’m still trying
to figure out.
That’s real; I never thought about it that way. Meanwhile, you’ve
been raising money by crushing pitch competitions. What’s
your secret?
I think it’s passion. You want people to know that it’s something you
would still do even if you made absolutely no money. Because if someone is
going to give you money, you still have to be just as passionate at 2:00 a.m.
as when you were up onstage asking for money. Another thing is that I know
my numbers. If you’re fumbling during questioning, then even if you’re
passionate, you’re not going to win. Also, I always pray before I pitch to
make sure that people are positively impacted by what I’m about to say.
If you could snap your fingers, how would you make us free?
If kweliTV is in the place where I want it to be in, let’s say, the next
fourteen years, I would try to eradicate Black unemployment. That would be
my mission. I have this really lofty idea where, if you’re a Black person and
you’re unemployed, I want to offer you a job paying a living wage, or
resources to start a business and hire other Black people. The reality is that
no matter how hard we work, no matter how many degrees we get, there
will still be people who will deny us jobs and access because we’re Black.
I’m not a separatist, but if we can hire each other, if we can help Black
people create our own companies, then we can be self-sufficient and paid
what we’re really worth. That’s my biggest dream.
        I resist White supremacy by using data science to dismantle the
    myths that sustain its power and creating digital pathways for more
              people to participate in advancing systemic solutions.

Three Questions for Appolition’s Dr. Kortney Ryan Ziegler and

## Tiffany Mikell

In 2017, Dr. Kortney Ryan Ziegler (creative director) and Tiffany Mikell
(managing director) created Appolition, an app that allows users to
automatically round up purchases and donate their change to bail relief for
Black people who are stuck behind bars simply because they can’t afford to
pay their way out. Inspired by the National Bail Out—a campaign that
works to reform the cash bail system and free people charged with
misdemeanors—they created the cleverly named Appolition in just four
months and were soon raising thousands in bail relief daily. “Why not play
on that word by using technology that’s going to prevent, in some ways, the
enslavement of Black folks in the United States?” Ziegler says.
Ziegler and Mikell chatted with Kenrya about the purpose and promise
of using their role as technologists to bolster the lived experiences of Black
people everywhere.
Why is Appolition an important project for you to pour your
energy into?
KZ: Honestly, it’s something higher. It’s part of our journey and our fate.
We’ve both been in technology for a long time, and we are also very radical
and believe in the civil liberties and rights and humanities of Black folks.
Being able to do something that can galvanize people on a global level is
just—it’s part of our thinking, design, and fate.
TM: All of our work together over the last three and a half years started
from a place of, “How do we use technology, design, and user experience,
to make the world a better place for Black people?”
How does the app help dismantle the system of White
supremacy?
TM: The beauty of Appolition is that all of the donations come from
individuals. There are some bail relief programs that are completely funded
by larger entities like foundations, and they’re oftentimes run by non-Black
people who are not really connected to the issue. Here, we’re doing it on our
own.
KZ: Right. Black Americans have tremendous spending power, so how can
we leverage being consumers? We are rerouting that money and using it to
help victims of the prison industrial complex.
TM: I think that because of White supremacy, a lot of times, when we talk
about the buying power of Black people, it’s from a place of shaming. We’re
shaming Black people for not being able to do certain things collectively in
spite of the buying power that we have. But because we understand how
White supremacy works, we understand the challenges that we face. It’s
been really cool to see how we can leverage that buying power to actually
free people while others work to secure policy changes. We’re showing that
there are multiple ways to address the problem, and we can all bring our
skills to the table and make a major impact.
What does freedom look like to you?
TM: I’m constantly asking myself, How can I bring my experience as a
Black woman who grew up in Chicago to this role? I know there are a lot of
Black people who feel like, in their professional roles, they have to leave all
of who they are at the door. I think it’s a shame. A big part of my life’s work
is creating organizations and safe spaces for brilliant Black people to come
and bring their full selves and create the things that they feel like have to
exist in the world, making sure that we embrace the Black community’s
brilliant, nonconforming creators. That’s what freedom looks like to me.
KZ: It’s important to be who I am as a Black person in the world. My ideal
of freedom for Black people is the ability to exist. Whatever that may mean,
in whatever space and whatever context.

## Attempts at Self-Care for a Corporate Black Girl

## “MacKenzie Jones”

Hair Story I: A Presentation
I was natural in college and decided that in order to get a finance job, I
needed to wear my hair a certain way. Now, I have coarse hair. There’s no
slicking it back with just water and gel. So I thought it would be easier to
perm it.
A few years in, after breaking up with a boyfriend who did not like
natural hair, I cut off my straight hair. My mom was like, “Uh, MacKenzie,
what do you plan to do with that?” I promptly went to an African braid shop
and got Senegalese twists.
At work, I knew it would be a big to-do. So I grabbed my coffee and my
ham-egg-and-cheese sandwich (don’t judge me) and got to work extra early
so I could avoid walking past a bunch of White coworkers on the floor and
in the hallway who would ask me about my hair.
It still happened, though. I went to a meeting that morning where I was,
as usual, the only Black person, the only woman, and the youngest person in
the room. I was giving a presentation when the most senior person in the
room asked, “How long did it take to do that?” I knew he meant my hair,
but I wanted him to say it directly. “How long did it take to prepare my
presentation?” I asked, playing dumb. And he was like, “No, your hair.”
This opened up the floodgates. Because the boss asked me about my
hair, the topic was fair game.
One guy goes, “When I was in Jamaica, I was thinking about getting
some braids,” and laughed. After a while, my direct supervisor interrupted
and said, “MacKenzie, you changed your hair. It looks nice. Can we move
on?” Only then could I go on with the presentation.
Hair Story II: Preferences
Once I had to pull aside one of my peers after I got braids for an
upcoming vacation because she said, “I really do prefer your hair that way.”
I said, “Well, it really doesn’t matter how you prefer it,” and went back
to talking about work.
But then she goes, “Oh, did we wake up on the wrong side of the bed?”
I laughed it off, but addressed it later that day. Her response? “I hope you
didn’t think what I said was off-putting. I was just giving you a
compliment.” The next time I changed my hair she mumbled that it was nice
and kept it moving. That was a victory. My hair should never be a
discussion at work. White people here change their hair all the time—they
color it, cut it, straighten it, get extensions. Disrupting a meeting or work
discussion is about people gawking at you and feeling ownership of you.

## Smiling

I have heard so many comments about how my tone of voice and my
face are aggressive. It’s like, “MacKenzie, you’re not smiling enough,” and
I’m like, I’m trying to calculate a fucking standard deviation ratio and you
want me to smile? I’ve had to put a lot of time into figuring out what to say
in these situations. I’ve landed on: “I appreciate the feedback. I’d like to
take a moment to think about it, and then schedule a follow-up, because I
want us to have a fruitful conversation.” They never follow up.

## Other People of Color

I’ve seen coworkers of color born in America say that recent immigrants
are too hard to understand. And then they imitate them. I want to ask them,
“What’s wrong with you?” Instead, I say, “Actually, I understand him. You
just need to listen a little closer.”

## Stereotypes

For most of my childhood, I would say my family was poor. Around high
school, my mother went back to school, so we became lower-middle-class. I
think this plays a role in how I see things. I want so badly to not be a
stereotype of a Black woman that I don’t ask for the help that I need. A lot
of success in my field is about connections and the story of your life. So
what do you do when you’re in an environment where you’re trying to defy
the stereotype, but you were the stereotype?
Wu-Tang Who?
Sometimes when White coworkers try to connect with me, they want to
discuss rap. I just play dumb. I remember one time I acted like I didn’t know
who the Wu-Tang Clan was.

## Plans

I tell my mentees, “Corporate America is cool, but you’ve got to have a
plan for what’s next.” I wish I’d had a plan for not staying in it too long. But
it is what it is, is it not?
“MacKenzie Jones” is the pseudonym of a thirty-something marketing executive at
a major financial firm in New York City.

## Bakari Kitwana on What Activism Is Worth

Bakari Kitwana is a writer, editor, and activist. Early in his career at
Chicago’s Third World Press, he edited titles like Frances Cress Welsing’s
The Isis Papers. He went on to become a political editor at The Source, and
his 2002 book, The Hip-Hop Generation, led to the formation of the
National Hip-Hop Political Convention, which attracted some four thousand
mostly Black and Brown young adults in 2004. Kitwana went on to found
Rap Sessions, a youth-centered discussion tour led by a panel of artists,
scholars, activists, and journalists as varied as Rhymefest, Tamika Mallory,
Sybrina Fulton, Marc Lamont Hill, Joan Morgan, Rashad Robinson, and
Michael Eric Dyson. In this Q+A, Akiba talks to Bakari about the value we
place on activism.
A major role that you play in Black organizing is that of a
connector. You’re always plugging someone into funding and
speaking engagements, talking up someone’s work, or helping
people who aren’t locked into elite institutions figure out how to
format and promote what they’re doing. Is this a natural
tendency?
I think it’s natural to a degree. But I also think that it’s rooted in
activism. Part of fighting White supremacy is fighting capitalism.
Connecting people is an anti-individualistic approach. And on a spiritual
level, nobody can stand in the way of what is for you; helping other people
isn’t interfering with you getting to where you have to go. I help people
because people have always helped me. None of us have gotten anywhere
on our own, even if we tell ourselves that mythology.
As my boss in the late ’90s at The Source, you were the first
person to say—out loud and with no shame—that people
should be paid livable wages for activist work. Back then, we
didn’t have Beyoncé saying, “F you, pay me.” We had to “do it
for the culture.”
You know, one of the big rifts in our history, particularly in the late ’60s
and the early ’70s, was between Marxists and cultural nationalists. Cultural
nationalism is often demonized among radicals, but one of the things they
had right was that we have to instill a sense of values into our people if
we’re going to win. In a capitalist economy, one of those values has to be
about economics. If we value the output of political knowledge, we have to
engrain that into the culture of our people.
A lot of how I think about this is influenced by how I was nurtured as an
activist and thinker. At Third World Press, I sat in conversations with
Nathan Hare, Gil Scott-Heron, Amiri Baraka, and Gwendolyn Brooks.
These folks were real people who were serious about the future of Black
people. They wanted to get paid and have their art and political ideas
valued, but they struck a balance. Gwendolyn Brooks used to say to me,
“Some stuff we’re just going to do for the people. But then we got to get out
here and make money so that we can still do those things for the people.”
Talk about how you involve local organizers in Rap Sessions,
given that speaking gigs are episodic.
We rarely go to a place where we haven’t been in ongoing conversation
with people who are organizing on the ground. This is an idea I gleaned
from Amiri Baraka. One of the things he said we needed to fight White
supremacy and capitalism was to create spaces around the country. His
emphasis was on cities where there’s a large Black population. So if we’ve
got an artist, poet, or author who’s speaking to our truth, we can take them
to at least ten cities around the country, and they can be in conversation with
Black people. Even though we’ve evolved out of that time, the value of that
is still important.

Stefanie Brown James and Quentin James Want You to Put Your

## Money Where Your Votes Are

Quentin James (executive director) and Stefanie Brown James (senior
advisor) launched The Collective in August 2016 with the goal of building
Black political power. The four-pronged organization—it includes a political
action committee (PAC) for collecting grassroots-level donations, a superPAC for soliciting the big bucks, a 501(c)(4) social welfare arm that allows
them to directly fund campaigns, and a nonprofit education fund—is
working overtime to increase the number of progressive Black elected
officials at the local, state, and federal levels. Both are veterans of major
political campaigns: Stefanie ran the national Black vote program for
Barack Obama, while Quentin did the same for Hillary Clinton. Kenrya
talked to the wife-and-husband team about why simply voting for your
favorite candidate isn’t good enough.
How did The Collective come to be?
QJ: In the summer of 2016, we saw an explosion of a lot of different issues,
including Trump’s campaign—which was obviously extremely racist—in
combination with more Black people being killed by cops and the
subsequent cases that were not being decided in favor of justice. A lot of
people rightfully directed their energy toward protesting. But at the same
time, there wasn’t an analysis around power and the individuals who hold it,
whether they be elected sheriffs or prosecutors or mayors who hire police
chiefs. We wanted to turn the focus of that outrage to people actually putting
their money into the political system.
I think Black people have been told the biggest lie in American political
history, which is that if we just vote everything will be okay. And what we
saw in 2012, with Stefanie’s leadership on the Obama campaign, is that
Black people voted at a historic high. But between 2012 and 2016, we saw
tremendous inequitable administration of the law when it came to criminal
justice reform. So obviously it’s not just about our votes. It’s also about our
money, and the fact that if you ask any Black politician in this country right
now, “Are the majority of your donors Black people in your community?”
the answer will be “no” 99 percent of the time.
We don’t have a stake in the game when it comes to our money, and
these things keep happening even though our community is voting. People
of color make up 40 percent of this country’s population, but we have this
huge underrepresentation. It can’t just be the same thing over and over:
register Black voters, get Black voters out to the polls. We need Black
prosecutors and state’s attorneys.
How do you reconcile asking folks to contribute financially with
the economic situation of Black people in this country?
QJ: The reality is, our situation is that Black buying power is at $1.3 trillion
per year, and we spend our money on what we value. The people we elect
control the biggest pot of money in the world—the United States budget.
And it comes from our tax dollars. They decide if we spend our money on
wars or schools, prisons or jobs. So that is power that we can yield with a
little investment. I’m not asking people to take a pay cut or give us 10
percent of their salary. But what we could do with just a portion of that $1.3
trillion would be amazing.
How do you decide which candidates to support?
QJ: First, candidates come to us and go, “Hey, I’m interested in your
endorsement.” Then we give them a candidate questionnaire. We ask them
everything from where they stand on criminal justice, civil rights, health
care, education, the economy—it’s pretty detailed. Once they pass that
questionnaire—and we define passing as scoring 90 percent or above—then
we assess their viability. Can they win the race? Then we take a vote; any
donor who has given us $1 to $5,000 gets an equal say on who we endorse
via a simple majority.
SBJ: Candidates have to truly fit what we’re looking for, as it relates to
focusing on progressive candidates who can make substantial changes
through their position.
What does “progressive” mean to you?
QJ: I think people want a candidate to be perfect, to be 100 percent of
where they want them to be on all the issues. So we said 90 percent, right?
It’s a lot of questions, but there are some pretty simple, progressive
questions that we think people should be able to answer. “Where do you
stand on a woman’s right to choose? Do you believe that climate change is
real? Are you willing to stand up to corporate interests? Do you want to
raise the minimum wage? Do you believe we should outlaw ‘stand your
ground’ laws?” We think if you get nine out of ten questions right, you’re
with us, you’re progressive.
How does The Collective help Black people resist White
supremacy?
QJ: I think one of the first ways is that we promote ownership of our
leaders. If we support them, not just with our votes but with our money, they
are very much beholden to their constituents. And people often think
“constituents” only means voters, but it also means donors. So if the
developers, if the corporate interests, are supporting all the Black
candidates’ campaigns, they’re also going to have an ear. It is White
supremacist to use money as a weapon, and until we realize that our money
can be used to resist White supremacy, we’re going to be in trouble.
SBJ: Having the option of an entity like The Collective gives people the
opportunity to be engaged in something that can make substantial changes
on the ground. Lack of access and the inability to channel your beliefs into
an institution that can create change stop progress. The Collective gives
people a tangible way to support Black candidates and in turn fight White
supremacy, which is working to continue to keep us subservient and
beholden. Our donors know this organization is theirs; they can see the
victories and the change we are bringing about collectively.
QJ: I would just add that the fact that White people are overrepresented in
our political system is a form of White supremacy. So by trying to equal
things out and get more Black people represented, we are literally resisting
White supremacy through the democratic process.
     I fight White supremacy by supporting authors, journalists, writers,
         podcasters, entrepreneurs, and community leaders of color.

## QUESTION, ANSWERED

It’s no surprise that money is a fraught topic—it touches every part of
our lives, for better and for worse. Here we tackle the question: what’s your
relationship with money?

## Kenrya

“How about you spend less time modeling self-sacrifice, and more time
modeling self-care?”
My therapist is dragging me again.
We’re talking about my relationship with money. I just confessed that
while I essentially work a part-time job to send my daughter to a private
school because the local joints are, shall we say, lacking, I have been
lovingly, longingly looking at the Sonicare electric toothbrush that I
abandoned in my Amazon cart six months ago because I feel guilty
spending $40 on myself when I could use it for her violin lessons or this
coding game I know she would love. Meanwhile, I bought her a more
expensive version of the toothbrush, plus two packs of replacement heads.
Hence the dragging, already in progress.

characteristics of a person, group, or institution.
I’ve never felt richer than I did on book delivery day as a kid. The homie
Google tells me that it’s all online now, but way back in elementary school,
I’d get hype when the teacher walked across the front of the classroom,
handing the kid at the head of each row a batch of four-page, full-color
newsletters that detailed all the books we could order from Scholastic that
month. I’d take mine from the hand of the person in front of me, grab a
pencil, and circle everything that looked mildly interesting, then spend the
evening curating the list, striking the things that seemed boring on second
read, and making sure I was properly advancing my collection of “The
Baby-Sitters Club” titles.
Then I’d tell my daddy it was book time, and he would hand me a signed
blank check. I’d total my books, make out the check, and hand it to my
teacher with the order form the next day. Two weeks later, I’d feel flush.
Most folks would get a book here or there, but I’d always have an entire box
of treasure to carry on the bus and dive into when I got home. The way that
I felt on book delivery days—loved and seen and cared for and lucky—still
sticks with me. My daddy might not have been able to buy me every toy I
begged for, but he spared no expense when it came to my favorite
companions.
We didn’t have a dining room in my childhood home. Why? ’Cause the
previous owners of our three-bedroom ranch-style house thought it would
be dope to have a stage instead.
It stood about five inches higher than the floor in the rest of the house
and was covered with the same deep brown carpet as the living room, which
it faced. One wall sported a window that looked out on the street, while the
other was covered in mirrors, floor to ceiling, in the shape of square tiles,
with smaller diamond-shaped mirrors that accented the corners where they
met. In the center of it all was an airbrushed picture of a mama koala bear
with a baby on its back. My little sister and I always said that was us, me
carrying her on my back while we feasted on bamboo. Our marsupial selves
were a captive audience as we sang into an old school microphone, handdanced with Daddy, and practiced twirling routines on that weird little stage.
The day that I let myself in from school and found my father—home
hours earlier than usual—sitting on the edge of the stage, glasses on the
floor beside him, long legs blocking the path to the rest of the house, I
immediately knew that something was wrong.
He had worked at a computer company for as long as I’d been alive, but
on that day he was laid off. And as he was raising us alone, our sole income
was gone.
We had always struggled to keep up in our suburban neighborhood. As
Daddy once explained when I asked why I couldn’t do something or other,
one income just didn’t go as far as the dual joints my suburban friends
enjoyed. They went on vacations and college tours and were presented at
cotillions on the weekends. I spent Saturday and Sunday at Granddaddy’s
house, playing drive-by with my cousins.
(Bare feet black with dirt from jumping over the extra-long phone cord
that passed as a rope, my cousins, my little sister, and I would scope the
street, looking left and then looking right past the long row of parallel
parked vehicles, waiting for a car to come barreling toward us. When we’d
see one in the distance, we’d abandon the hot asphalt, dash past the scraggly
tree lawn and the strip of sidewalk, and hide behind the row of short bushes
that rimmed my granddaddy’s yard, as if they could stop the bullets we
imagined the drivers were spraying at us.)
But we ate well, and our gas was usually on, if not our lights. My father
stretched himself to root us in a neighborhood with excellent public schools
because he knew that while there is no such thing as a great equalizer,
education is the closest thing we have.
To make that happen, he sacrificed himself, carving off small pieces of
his well-being and offering them up to my sister and me, his creditors, and
the many people—from blood relatives to a family that was experiencing
homelessness—who slept on our couches for months at a time. He’d skip
lunch to make sure we had enough to buy those cardboard-ass pizza squares
in the cafeteria. He’d wear the same pair of high tops until they were mushy
and gray, barely recognizable as shoes. He’d wait to get haircuts until he
was barely recognizable.
The pieces just got larger after he was “downsized”; he eventually
landed as a subcontractor servicing one of his former clients, dropping from
a steady salary to hourly pay that squeezed us tighter. But he persisted,
constantly working and somehow finding a way to pay for most of the things
we needed, if not always the things we wanted.
These days, as I offer up my can’t-see hours to finance my daughter’s
education and social calendar, I understand the method behind his madness.
But having insight into his motivation doesn’t mean that it isn’t mad.

## *
Pattern. An original or model considered for or deserving of imitation.
In my willingness to do anything for my Saa-Saa—she of the soft brown
skin, bright eyes, quick mind, and awful jokes—I thought I was making her
feel loved and cared for, like I felt on book delivery days. And maybe I am,
in the short term. But subjecting her to my marathon work sessions, my
exhausted and distracted mind, and my old school–brushed teeth is really
just teaching her the same lesson that I got from my father: You should find
pleasure in taking care of the people around you and feel guilty about taking
care of yourself.
Over the years this belief led me to a bank account that was depleted
from spending to meet the wants and needs of others, lopsided relationships
where I was more caretaker and secretary than equal partner, and a therapist
who forced me to read a book about codependency.
And it doesn’t stop at being a martyr in my personal relationships. Black
women in the United States are paid 67.7 cents for every dollar paid to
             †
White men. I’ve been taught both at home and in these White supremacist
streets (which are really the same thing, thanks to the toxic sea of racism
and sexism we’re swimming in, thanks) that it’s not cool to demand what
I’m worth. I’m expected to accept what I’m offered, or what will enable me
to just get by, and use a fear of scarcity as my excuse for not wringing the
joy out of each moment.
I do not want that for my child.
Pattern. Consistent and recurring characteristic or trait that helps in the
identification of a phenomenon or problem and serves as an indicator or
## *
model for predicting its future behavior.
It’s time for something new, for both of our sakes. I’m taking my therapist’s
advice and fashioning a new pattern that involves making space for myself
financially, even as the world tells me that is selfish and shortsighted.
Recently, Saa and I tied our tennis shoes and headed out for a walk to the
neighborhood studio where she takes a drop-in West African dance class
with a Senegalese instructor. The breeze was a bit biting, but the sun was
bright, and I tipped my face toward it as we strolled.
Each time my mind alerted me that I was supposed to be writing this
essay or that I had a spring wardrobe of big kid clothes sitting in my Target
app cart waiting for me to make the money to buy them, I deflected the
thoughts, sending them hurtling into the distance as I reminded myself that
joy, like what I felt strolling in the sun with Saa, is more precious than guilt
—lighter too.
When we made it home hours later, I ordered Thai food because I was
too exhausted to cook. Full and satisfied, I put away my phone so I wouldn’t
be distracted, then camped out on the floor with the little one for rounds of
Uno and whatever the Ikea version of Jenga is called. Then I dozed while
she lay on me and sketched a fabulous tiered dress that she dubbed
“Sherbet.” Just before putting her to bed, I found my phone, popped open
the Amazon app, and bought that fucking toothbrush. Here’s to living in our
abundance.

## Akiba

I’ve always admired people who are proactive and intentional with
money. I like the idea of having a savings account at like age five, buying a
home, buying rental properties, having enough cash to work with a financial
planner, having a college fund for your kids, saving six months’ worth of
operating funds in case you get laid off, using coupons, eating the lunch you
made at home, having perfect credit, paying every single bill on time, and
turning off all of the gottdamn lights because are you going to pay this
electric bill?
For the most part I’ve been lucky. I am a single, childless writer and
editor in expensive-ass New York City, but I know that if crisis comes
calling, I can move back home to Philly to the two-parent, paid-in-full house
where I was raised.
Both of my parents are college-educated and retired from full-time jobs
with savings. From day one they made it clear that my sister and I were
going away to college on scholarship. (“Mom, do we have a college fund?”

## “Yeah. Your brains.”)

After an early foray into entrepreneurship—selling shiny rocks, making
comics, peddling Kwanzaa cookies as one half of the “Ujamaa Bakers”—I
started working at fourteen. It was a summer job at CoreStates Bank, filing
canceled checks next to adults who had the Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and MCM
bags I envied.
Compared to my Black peers with single moms, we did pretty well.
Politically speaking, we were not supposed to even care about that. All of
our clothes came from Jomar’s, House of Bargains, Artie’s, and Marshalls.
One time, during the designer jean craze of the ’80s, my mom snagged me a
pair of Pierre Cardins at an outlet. I went around the house chanting, “Pierre
Car-DIN!” in what I believed was a French accent. My mother scratched out
the labels.
Lesson learned.
But things changed when, after several school strikes and denied
applications to our local magnet school, my parents shipped my sister and
me off to a predominantly White, all-girls prep school in the Philadelphia
suburbs. We were Black superstar geniuses benefiting from the affirmative
action that our ancestors sacrificed for and that we certainly deserved. The
people at that school were White and rich. They had “au pairs” and summer
homes. They had multiple bathrooms and swimming pools. Their jackets
had those crumpled-up zipper tags that one gets during a ski trip.
Everybody lived in the suburbs and some would ask dumb questions like,

## “Do you see pools of blood on your street?”

One night my mom hit the Lotto and called what seemed like all of her
girlfriends screaming, “I WON FIFTY DOLLARS IN THE
LOTTERYYY!” I bragged about this at school the next day. But when I
disclosed that it was a $50 come-up, I got peculiar looks and silence. These
third-graders carried $20 bills in their LeSportsacs.
These early experiences created a class-consciousness that I will
charitably call “multilayered.”
We went to private school, summer camp, music and art class,
gymnastics, ballet, African dance, screen-printing, and a bunch of other
activities. Occasionally our only living grandparent, Mamie Nichols, would
take the whole family out to Seafood Shanty, where we’d ball out on shrimp
cocktail and Shirley Temples. Our clothes were not hot, but we wore
uniforms anyway. My sister and I were able to circumvent most of the ’hood
entry points into conspicuous consumption due to my parents’ politics and
the fact that the rich White girls at school couldn’t make a distinction
between us and any other Blacks.
At White girl school, Asali and I were “poor.” When we first got there,
me in the third and my sister in the fourth grade, White girls we had never
met invited us to their homes for dinner. I still wonder if they thought we
were Feed the Children recipients.
Then there was a bizarre, Negro-on-Black incident in which some of the
parents whose kids went to ours and other area prep schools invited Asali
and me to join Jack and Jill, then revoked the invitation because we “lived
in the city.”
By far the most confusing and damaging class-related trauma I faced
came at the hands of one of the few Black girls in my class. She lived in the
city like me, and we bonded over freestyle battles and the nightly
countdown on Power 99. This girl’s dad owned a market, but there was not
much on the shelves and everything was dusty. She was “light-brownskinned” with “good” hair, which, by non-crunchy, non–Black nationalist
standards, was supposed to mean that she was better than me. One time this
frenemy and her mother popped up at our home uninvited. They just didn’t
believe that our dark-skinned asses could have a house when they lived in an
apartment.
And there were a few violent incidents between us. After trying
unsuccessfully to humiliate me in front of the White girls with poorly drawn
diagrams of the African art at our house, she lunged at me. Ultimately, I
came very close to throwing her out a window. Another time, during a rare
out-of-uniform day, she ripped my flannel, big-shirt-over-leggings situation
wide open to expose my puny nibblets wrapped in a white bra. Shoving and
slapping ensued.
But this girl’s attempt to be better based on internalized White
supremacy (that was not her fault, I should note) backfired in the Blackest
of ways. At slumber parties we were pity-invited to, she would bring like
eighty pairs of pajamas. These White girls didn’t even shower in the
morning. “She’s an obnoxious show-off,” one such girl told me as she
brushed her long hair in one of the four bathrooms in the house.
What I learned from this amalgam of experiences is that being rich and
White meant being proudly oblivious to what you had, laughing at lowerincome people of color who tried to look rich like you, calling Italians and
other ethnic White folks “mall-chicks,” and screaming, “My dad works at
the stock exchange!” in a pinch.
Whiplash!
Here lies the suspect benevolence of rich White girls I didn’t know;
some mean-spirited classism from suburban Black adults; a frenemy whose
good hair didn’t do anything for her family’s bottom line; and a deep shame
about knowing any of this.
What kind of child of Black nationalists gains intimate knowledge of
class politics across race, immigration status, and ethnicity from a suburban
prep school ? To me, not a proper one. I took simplifying matters very
seriously. I bought the biggest gold earrings I could afford, lots of Reeboks,
and multiple Liz Claiborne bags with my job money. I entertained a
certified nut-jawn drug peddler from Richard Allen Projects in hopes that he
would catch me up on what I’d missed. I wore seven different permed
hairstyles at one time while my family looked on with concern and then
annoyance. I gave boys on the el the wrong name but the right number,
because I was scared to be too bougie with, “No.” I dreamed of being
another iteration of the Malcolm X that Public Enemy and everybody else
exalted.
Then my baba from down the way busted me with the realest things ever
said to my confused self. Some things like, “You are not Malcolm X. The
Klan didn’t kill me, and your mother is alive. You were never separated
from your sister. You were never hungry. You’re not a pimp, a number
runner, or going to jail. You’re not getting a process that you have to wash
out in the toilet. You’re not a minister in the Nation of Islam. You’re not
getting murdered for the people. Be yourself, please.”
This lesson settled in at Howard University, home of Black folks who
had actual generational wealth. Some were ridiculous, and many were cool,
even as lifetime members of the Links or Jack and Jill. I met AKAs, Deltas,
Alphas, Kappas, and study-abroad students. I met artists from all over the
country. I met historians and engineering students. Some had nice cars and
went to cotillions but did not act a damn fool about it.
In adulthood, I have come to understand that if you are not poor, you
have choices for yourself and your family, have uncontaminated drinking
water, have nephews living charmed lives, have uncontested citizenship
rights, are cisgender and straight, have a college education, have not been
incarcerated for being poor and possessing two joints, have not been
financially or physically abused by a sadistic man, have never had police or
a vigilante kill or maim you or a loved one, have a family that is still alive
for the most part and can afford to take care of you when you get very sick,
have a sister with a PhD and an MFA, have a place that pays you to write,
edit, and think, have the freedom to say “White supremacy” with few overt
consequences so far—your story is a funny-at-times tale of Black workingto middle-class girl angst.
     I make enough to eat out rather than cook (poorly). After many, many
years of freelancing, I have benefits, taxed income, and paid vacation days. I
get to pretend that I don’t care if a suitor has enough money for us to be on
equal footing when I’m too working-class for that to be true.
     I still occasionally look around my rent-stabilized apartment and wonder
what I might peddle in case this whole thing goes off the rails. But I know,
thanks to my family, education, and early job experience, how to hustle up
legal cash. When I’m able to retire at eighty-six, I’m going to take my
nephews to a Seafood Shanty–type establishment every once in a while.
And if anyone ever again asks me about my relationship with money and
how that is connected to resisting White supremacy, I will be able to say

## without an ounce of glibness: “It’s complicated.”

* I think that the United States itself is the invention of Whiteness and that Whiteness has two

expressions. The most primary expression is organized violence. This line is about Whiteness as a
deputization that exists to keep enslaved Africans in check.
† I’m speaking to class versus race here. There’s the class analysis that says that the principal
contradiction in society is rich versus poor, ruling class versus the oppressed. And you have schools
of radical thought that say it’s not class, it’s Black versus White. I think it’s more of a complicated
hybrid of the two, where both realities are at play with, reinforce, and sometimes contradict each
other.
‡ This line is not to say that all we need is armed resistance, but to say that any solution or any
resistance to White supremacy that doesn’t come to terms with the fact that it is completely tied to an
organization of violence—a monopoly of violence—is not going to get us to the Promised Land.
Money can express some things, but money will not save us. And then the extension of it is this: If
you cannot get resistance out of a dollar, then what is that dollar really doing? That dollar to me is
really evidence of our surrender. What you’re really saying is, “We give up. We don’t really want any
problems. And you can continue to brutalize whoever you want to brutalize here and abroad, kill
whatever you want to kill, and enforce and really enforce an insane mode of production.”

* This just means that to resist White supremacy is to accept that there will be state or statesanctioned violence against you.

† What are some of the units or atoms or molecules of a monopoly of violence? One of them is
giving the White vigilante, the White police officer, absolute rein and power to do whatever they
want. I mean, it was law in some places that when insurrection appeared to be afoot, White people
had to patrol African people. It was like, literally, “You are drafted.” You could kill anybody as long
as the person who so-called owned the African felt compensated fairly enough or thought you did
them a favor by killing a possible seed of rebellion. That’s the way a vigilante, the way that a soldier
of Whiteness, is programmed—to not see a human being and to only be trying to enforce one thing:
their absolute power.

## SOMEDAY WE’LL ALL BE FREE

The point of this whole thing isn’t just to fight White supremacy; it’s to destroy it and create something that is liberatory for all. But we can’t
accomplish this without having a vision of what our own liberation looks
like. That’s why we all need to document our freedom dreams. Our picture
of a place without police brutality, mass incarceration, grinding poverty,
mass unemployment, untreated mental illness, early death, substandard
education, gun violence, hate violence against Black trans women,
homophobia, and sexism, must come from folks across the spectrum. In this
chapter, we hear from futurists, survivalists, trans rights activists, and more
about what they do each day to free themselves and how we can sprint
toward a just future. Together.

## Start with Quanshay

I can tell you how we fight. I can’t tell you how we win. That’s probably
obvious. If I knew, if we knew, the whole thing would be different. The long
nightmare would be over, and we would be in the middle of the next epoch
of our collective being. Maybe that would be like Wakanda, or the Republic
of New Afrika, or Atlantis, or a great big neo-Atlanta. Who knows? We’re
here, though. And we can fight. We do fight. And knowing how to fight, I
think, is identifying the necessary. It is about hitting the right note with our
state of being even when the piano is out of tune. Even when we want to
throw the damn thing out the window and let it crash into a million splinters
on the concrete.
The world knows, but it denies, that Black people love being Black. Of
course, I don’t mean every single Black person loves being Black. We can
think of some very prominent exceptions to that rule who have surnames
like Dash, Thomas, and Carson. But it’s true. Loving being Black is a
commonplace state for Black folks, even in this White supremacist country
in a White supremacist world. Sit in a room with Black folks for a day, or
even just a few hours, or for fifteen minutes on a street corner, and the fact is
undeniable. We love the heft of our laughter. We love the swing of our
voices and the timing of our bodies, the subtlety of our eyebrow gestures
and glances, the thickness of our own embraces. We love our mastery of
combinations and permutations—the mathematics of our entertainment—
with cards, dice, stories, and dance. We love the way we praise the higher
power, however we call her. We love the knot of our genealogical ways of
being that allow us to slip in and out of each other’s neighborhoods and
nations and find a way in wherever we go because we know the language
even if we don’t know the language. My friend Nate once said to me, “It’s a
myth that we can’t go back to Africa. Start telling jokes with the kids in the
village and you’re back in a minute.” He’s right. We don’t have a Standard
English term for this, but we know that robust good feeling of being inside
of being with other Black people.
Despite this truth, we are forced to listen to a steady parade of well-paid
commentary about how we don’t love being Black. It goes like this: “I
wanted to be White. I hated myself. I changed my voice. I wasn’t like the
other Black kids.” On and on and on. “There!” I imagine some collective
White supremacist personality (or publisher) saying. “I fixed it. We have
told them they are inferior and they believe it. Told you!” Ridiculous. Okay,
I admit that some of us believe this pernicious lie. But most of us know in
our guts that it isn’t true. We are definitely not inferior. We are in fact
remarkable and breathtakingly beautiful. And what a marvelous resilience
that is. Really.
As far as I am concerned, knowing it is good to be Black even when it is
terrible to be Black is at the core of how we fight. Start from there and Bob
Marley’s “emancipate yourself from mental slavery” and the Funkadelics’
“free your mind and your ass will follow”—those one-sentence sermons—
have a chance to come true.
Black names, from African to African American vintage, are a good
example. We like the sounds of a hard k and a kwa and a sh. We like -ay at
the end. And for some reason we like to borrow the flourishes of French at
the same time as we keep the rounded sounds of Bantu languages. Our
names are a common source of mockery, sometimes even from our own.
Well, it is true: We like to make up names from an old grammar of sounds
that came before Columbus. And just think about what it means to celebrate
sounds of our own, to claim them as the banners of our identities. It is a
defiant deed in a White supremacist society.
No matter what they say, we aren’t naming our daughters “Susie.”
So whenever someone makes fun of Black “made-up names,” I remind
them that Milton made up the name Susannah. And I ask, “Do you mean to
say that only White men are allowed to make things up?” They usually get
uncomfortable. But I am very serious. The Black imagination is essential
for the road to freedom.
When I was seven years old, I told my teacher that the map of Africa in
our classroom was wrong. It said Rhodesia, but the Black people had
reclaimed that country as Zimbabwe. I had been taught that renaming was
decolonial. To her credit, my teacher, Risa (it was a progressive school; we
called them by their first names), took a piece of tape and wrote Zimbabwe
over where Rhodesia had been. Like many other African-named children of
the 1970s, I was raised to reject the colonized mind. Steve Biko’s lessons in
Black consciousness had been put into practice as the enterprise of
parenting.
I like to think I have carried that on. I tell my children when they learn in
school to call European expansionism “The Age of Exploration” to
remember that it was the age of unjust conquest. I like to think that when
my younger son is tasked with doing a language project and he chooses
African American Vernacular English, and when my older son says the
foreign language that he is most interested in learning is Jamaican Patois,
that this is part of the work of emancipation—this is the work of freedomfighting.
     The point, I hope, is clear. But in case it isn’t, I will be more explicit: the
boldness of our laughter comes from the same fabric as insisting upon other
ways of knowing, ways that weren’t built on the altar of our degradation and
subjugation. It is of the same fabric as having vocabularies and designations
of our own design. To tell our story truthfully is to turn the official story on
its head again and again, based on the core principle of loving who we are.
     To get from there to here, however, from the rough act of self-love to a
deliberate way of being, is community work. We have models for it. We
have books and a history of schools and organizations. There is a lot to draw
upon. The problem, however, is so often when we embark upon that work
we start from a place of denigration of what is. We repeat the core
formulations of White supremacism with “the problem is that Black
people…” as a precursor to “where do we go from here?”
     But what if, instead, we begin with “the beauty is that Black people…”?
What if we begin the story of our greatness and our possibilities with where
we are and what we love about ourselves right now? What if we see in the
grammar of our dances a thousand permutations on grace under pressure.
What if we see a refusal to be held captive in the timbre and echo of our
voices, which carry even when we are held in cages, or behind invisible
electrified fences of ghettoization, or under leaden glass ceilings. I believe
that is how we must fight.
     Start right here.

      I fight White supremacy by understanding its nuances. Most racism
        and oppression isn’t overt; but by pointing out racism at its subtle
          level to my sons, I equip them to avoid and beat covert White

What were you thinking when you planned and created this
work?
I was thinking about creating a modular, mobile, and elevated housing
construct driven by an experimental yet organic design and sited within a
repressive political economy.
How does this work resist White supremacy?
A good deal of my artwork that derives from my background in
architecture is about resisting or confronting White supremacy in some
form or other. In this case, it’s the very act of imagining spaces for Black
people in the future. In the present, urban development often fails to
adequately consider the needs of marginalized communities. This piece is
an act of resistance against erasure and a history of discriminatory housing
practices.

## What Freedom Feels Like

## Maori Karmael Holmes

What I’m interested in for Black people in the United States is that we
would be free to have a mundane life. To wake up, to go to the store, to
shop, to see our lovers, to come home, to watch television—all without
considering the White gaze. And not watching somebody grab their purse in
the elevator, or dealing with microaggressions at work, or skipping the
major you love because a racist counselor said, “You can’t.”
I don’t think freedom would look the same for everybody; I’m actually
more curious about what it would feel like. It would hinge on being able to
make decisions that aren’t based on a legacy of trauma or impoverishment.
We would no longer have to choose how we take up space—or don’t take up
space—as a response to this world, even down to the clothes we wear. For
example, when I see free White people, particularly the wealthy people I’ve
met, I notice how they’re free to wear the same clothes every day. They
don’t dress up if they don’t feel like it; they dress up if they want to. Either
way, they’re making these decisions purely based on their own interest. To
me, that’s what freedom would feel like.

The Eight-Point Plan of Euphorically Utopic World-Making

## Elissa Blount Moorhead

My father took me to see Miles Davis a few times growing up. What
struck me most was his now-infamous tendency to play music with his back
to the audience. Some say it was not a deliberate act of defiance, but rather a
deep focus on his work and his stagemates. Maybe he would’ve said, “My
back was not to the audience; I was facing my band.” Regardless of his
reason, to my young eyes it was a gesture that resonated as a manifesto for
so many aspects of life. It called out to me: “Don’t look over your shoulder.
Let the world come find you—you don’t have to go to it. When they do find
you, be totally into and enjoying your own bag.”
In other words, I haven’t really given Whiteness my back. I am facing
Blackness.
I’ve had a few bags throughout my life—career, crews, cities—but the
bag for which I have always had an unwavering love is Blackness. I never
tire of pondering who we are and what we do. I suspect it has to do with
what I am retroactively calling the “Eight-Point Plan of Euphorically Utopic

## World-Making.”

This is the plan that my counterculture parents created. Their insistence
on world-making shaped our current existence and our understanding of it
—specifically, their experiments in child-rearing. I was taught to
decentralize any notion of the White gaze, which means I had a fighting
chance at agency, self-worth, and cultural entitlement in a country dead set
against us having any of it.
I grew up in Washington, DC, during the time of liberation movements,
communes, pan-Africanism, shules, arts movements, Islam, Vodou, and
Black political and cultural nationalism. Black folks, including my parents,
were searching for alternative ways to live together and raise a new
consciousness. They were clear that being raised in an intentional
community of Black artists, thinkers, activists, and pioneers was going to
give us the grounding we needed to not just avoid the White gaze and
misguided ideas of White “supremacy” but to utterly ignore its existence.
Don’t get me wrong. There were inconsistencies. They were jumping off
cliffs and building wings on the way down. Most parents are really figuring
it all out in real time.
Even though the world at that time was trying to convince them racial
integration was salvation, they knew that was not enough. A half-century
before “Black Lives Matter” was a mantra, they bet on Black and, in my
opinion, won.
Some of these memories started to congeal when I had my first child. I
began to recall these stories under loose categories that protected me (as
much as possible) from White “supremacy” during my formative years.

## 1. Squad

When I was young, I never understood why people of color were called
“minorities” when we comprised the majority of the world. Of course, later
I came to understand this Western fiction was a tactic to advance the idea of
Whiteness. It was a numbers game and a proximity mind trick. Whiteness
was a catchy recruiting tool that allowed anyone throughout history wishing
to distance themselves from Blackness to promote my inferiority.
But DC in the 1970s and ’80s looked more like the rest of the globe.
This was nearly an all-Black city—residents, leadership, services, and
commerce. It’s home to Howard University, nicknamed “the Mecca,” which
is what drew my parents there. Growing up in DC made it easy for me to
take this fact of our majority status for granted.
Once, after college, a Black friend from London came to visit for the
first time. I was amused by the first places he wanted to visit. “Where can
we get bean pies?” he asked. “Let’s go to Howard and where are the gogos?” After a day of fairly mundane hanging in the city, he said, “My God,
everyone is beautiful! The traffic cop, the bank teller, just regular people,
are fine.”
His being awestruck made me realize that I had a sense of entitlement
that rested, not in the fact that I had Black teachers, leaders, and visual
validation, but in my ability to be nonplussed about it. If someone said the
phrase “French bakery,” my mind’s eye went to Avignon Frère, where
Francophone Africans would hang out. When I imagined a pediatrician, she
would be kind-faced, brown Dr. Clark on Sherman Avenue.
      Numbers mattered when I was formulating identity. Because I had
numbers, I didn’t have to count. There was a deep-down “they can’t kill us
all” kind of safety, to assume the whole world looked and lived like me.

## 2. Isolation

      Doing away with America’s “separate and unequal” brand of segregation
was the Civil Rights Movement’s raison d’être. However, since Brown v.
Board of Education was decided, some Black people have spoken in hushed
tones about the negative effects of desegregation. If you listen closely, you
will hear longing for many attributes of segregation. You’ll hear yearnings
for the space to elevate spirit via Black sociality and euphoria. That seems
essential to me.
      So my assumption is that the Black psyche has been impaired or at least
affected by the White gaze. Even in all-Black spaces, the specter of the
White gaze fuels our perpetual impulse toward doing what is deemed
respectable. I came to believe that we could interrupt this impulse with
room to try things on and fail without it being attributed to Blackness or
lack thereof.
      I remember being mildly chided in high school as “punk rock.” At the
same time, I was voted “Most Creative.” Today I realize that people calling
me “punk rock” was a way of saying that I was into some weird stuff that
wasn’t really that Black but did not make me an outcast.
      With Whiteness out of the frame, this was, “Lisa who likes weird shit,”
but I was not “acting White.” I had no real-life pressure to avoid
“Whiteness” because it wasn’t present in my life. In other words, in
isolation my behavior and preferences were not raced and categorized in the
face of “Whiteness.” I don’t want to confuse this with a post-Black
ideology. This is more about transcendence and disregard of White people’s
view of us. It’s Black privilege.

## 3. Multiplicity

Many scholars have written about what it means to remain at the
“epicenter” of Blackness. Freedom from a one-dimensional view of
Blackness allows for rigorous discourse and more expansive notions of what
Blackness does and can mean.
Living in a diverse Black community allowed me a window into our
diasporic bounty. Living in a Black community in America means the
sinners and the saints all look like you and are potentially connected by
history, circumstance, and culture. We see ourselves for intrinsic traits, not a
romanticized Blackness.

## 4. Haughtiness

Segregation or isolation would not have been enough. Expressions of
“Black is beautiful” were almost compensatory for what America was
dishing out. I’m guessing this is what we needed to level things after church
burnings and hoses. But alongside this prideful proclamation was also
benevolence—the cousin of haughtiness.
Benevolence is usually reserved for the group of people holding power.
But in my near-utopic example, power was a shifted perception.
Benevolence allowed for a lack of ire that is not typically associated with a
Black Power stance. I remember my mother and grandmother talking about
the dysfunctional behavior of our people that we’d hear about on the news.
They would say, “Poor thing. He doesn’t know any better. He was taught
that.” There may not have been genuine feelings of sympathy, but the
performance of superiority resonated with me.
Whiteness, to me, was the condescending pity and its belief that it was
above it all. So my grandmother would not answer if a White person called
her by her first name or used the wrong tone. Her haughtiness worked as an
antidote to White “supremacy.” Disregard as resistance had another side
effect: the erasure of the excuse that racism is a “sickness” rather than a
learned culture. This was the ultimate high-siddity smackdown.

## 5. Global Context

When I was young, a five-year-old girl in my building spoke five
languages that I knew of, including Amharic and English. When you got on
the elevator, she could size you up based on gestures or clothing or style and
speak to you in the correct language. I think about how she had so many
keys to various kinds of Black thought and culture so early. In our apartment
building, there were French/Kreyol speakers from Haiti and West Africa
and Spanish speakers from the Dominican Republic and Central America.
Not to mention Brazilians, South Africans, and West Indians from at least
eight islands. It was a Black United Nations. Before I even traveled out of
the United States, I knew I belonged and was not a minority. I knew that
Pelé played a game more popular than baseball and that slavery did not take
everything away.

## 6. Chill

When I first went to college at American University, I remember
meeting students who claimed to have always been the only Black person in
their schools or communities. This sounded heartbreaking.
Folks who are performing Blackness or proving (or disproving) their
connection to it all the time carry an unfair burden. Quiet confidence comes
from mastery of work and ideas, but also of self.
Last year I dropped off my niece at the hairdresser before her orientation
at the Mecca. The hairdresser said, “Congrats! What high school did you
graduate from? She said “Friends” (a private Quaker School). The
hairdresser said, “What made you choose Howard?” Without taking a breath

## my niece said, “Friends.”

## 7. Fun

Once when I was eight or nine, a girl from my second DC school—a
middle-class to wealthy Black school—came to my apartment. Seeing all
the pictures of Black heroes and African art, she said, “Do your parents
lecture you about Black stuff all the time? Do they hate White people?”
Funny enough, they didn’t do either. We just lived. There were always
people at our apartment late, smoking weed, listening to records, arguing,
and laughing. I loved the residue of it all. We lived in museums and at
cultural events. We didn’t know we were technically poor.
My wealthier friends I went to school with had similar fun—basement
dances, roller skating, slumber parties where we’d pore over Right On and
fight over who was going to marry Michael Jackson or Foster Sylvers. So
Blackness always seemed lit to me.
     Often, in an attempt to make sure our kids don’t forget who they are, we
make things prescriptive and, as one of my friends says, we take the fun out
of profundity. We think ceremony and lessons are the only way to get them
to know our history. But we are making our history now by loving,
laughing, and being ourselves in front of them. Making sure I continue my
version of my parents’ fellowshipping is soul-feeding for me, and I hope it
will make my kids want to hold on to their uncut joy free of any outside
gaze. Full. Out. Lit.

## 8. Evidence and Expectation

     Maybe I never bought the “White man runs the world” story because my
near-utopian reality showed me too much to the contrary for too long. For
me, there was no evidence of anyone but Dr. Clark and Marion Barry
running the world. Really well, I might add. I knew that President Jimmy
Carter was White, but his daughter went to public school in DC too, one
that was not as good as mine. At my school, we sang “Lift Every Voice and
Sing” every morning, so I thought all schools did.
     No matter how hard you worked, teachers would say you weren’t
working to your potential. That bar was raised hourly. I remember thinking,
Well, maybe this is my full potential, lady. Leave me alone. But I soon
learned there was no ceiling. Teachers would then say, “This is your best?
Please, child, I know your parents.” Which is code for “You come from
good stock,” which is code for “We all we got,” which is code for “You
must win because you are mine.” Even when naïveté wore off as an adult
and I understood the economic realities, injustice, and racism we faced, I
still couldn’t buy it. No White man is running my world. Evidence was
everywhere.
     It was rare, too special, a coincidence of time and place that we will
never get back.
     My kids’ schools are far from Shepherd or Harriet Tubman Elementary
where I went, so I supplement with summer Freedom School—any element
of this eight-point plan will have to do for now. I am trying to replicate what
I can, when I can. It has to be strong enough to endure racist governments
and all-White classrooms. It has to be seen and felt, not implied. There has
to be evidence.

We Can’t Get Free by Osmosis: A Q+A with Robin D. G. Kelley
Robin D. G. Kelley is the Distinguished Professor and Gary B. Nash
Endowed Chair in US History at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Outside of academia, the writer, educator, cultural critic, and activist is
renowned for using his dizzyingly multidisciplinary talent to talk about
Black culture and politics with clarity and verve. His study of Black
working-class social movements—including the books Race Rebels:
Culture, Politics, and the Black Working Class and Freedom Dreams: The
Black Radical Imagination—is what compelled us to talk to him for this
project. Read on as he emails with Akiba.
These words on your website about your 1996 book, Race
Rebels, stood out: “I concluded that there is nothing inherently
radical or oppositional about daily acts of resistance and
survival; the relationship of these acts to power always depends
on the context.” Can you talk more about this conclusion?
The key words in that quote are “inherently” and “context.” I don’t want
to give the impression that these everyday acts of resistance or survival are
not valuable. On the contrary, the whole point of the book is to insist that
we cannot understand working-class politics without paying attention to the
realm of these everyday, quotidian kinds of struggles.
But to assume that these are conscious acts of rebellion or that they lead
inexorably to revolution, the idea that they are proto-revolutionary and
whatnot, is simply wrong. It both underestimates and overestimates our
communities. What I mean is that we don’t always recognize what a diverse
and complicated people we are and how any number of tired terms like
“rebel” or “reformist” or “integrationist” or “separatist” obscure more than
they reveal. Even under White supremacy, we are not obsessed with this
system or White folks or being oppressed. We are sometimes struggling
with mundane problems, seeking joy, falling in and out of love, raising
children, or more concerned with dignity than, say, protest. We do stupid
things, exhibit vanity and selfishness and many other things that some might
dismiss as signs of lacking consciousness. But how we come to know the
world is usually through a dialectic of experience, knowledge, and reflection
on both. This leads me to the second key word: “context.”
A style, a gesture, music, even literacy may be looked upon by
authorities as subversive and dangerous in one context, and a marketable
commodity in another context. And the threat it may pose for White
supremacy may not be evident to those who engage in these acts. In some
instances, Black working people acted in ways that were never meant to
“resist” anything, but the context—the policing of Black working-class
behavior, the monitoring of Black life, the way the state perceived their acts
as threats—rendered their actions resistance whether intended or not.
Furthermore, everyday resistance strategies can become double-edged
swords. Vicious attacks on Black passengers by bus drivers could convince
others of the futility of fighting back. Impeccable job performance as a
strategy to challenge racial inequality at the workplace ultimately benefits
the employer. Employing one’s own labor for more pleasurable pursuits
hardly alters social relations. And yet, like all double-edged swords, these
same acts can temporarily disrupt the business of White supremacy by
throwing a wrench into its operations, by instilling communities with a
sense of dignity denied them by the racial regime, and by enabling folks to
reverse the process of exploitation by taking back some of the surplus
extracted from them. These things happen every day. The question is, how
do we make meaning of these daily acts and skirmishes? And can they
become the basis for disrupting the system we’re trying to dismantle?
What do Black folks get out of valuing and even romanticizing
everyday struggle? Did it ever make sense?
      There is certainly no consensus among Black folks on the value of
everyday struggle. Some of my biggest critics have been Black intellectuals
who see no value in studying everyday resistance, arguing instead that they
are diversions from “real” social movements. On the other hand, I’m
surrounded by many students, colleagues, and activists who want to hold up
these acts as evidence of Black people’s “agency” or “humanity”—a claim I
find incredibly dubious and that was powerfully critiqued recently by Walter
Johnson in his October 26, 2016, Boston Review essay, “To Remake the
World: Slavery, Racial Capitalism, and Justice.”
      I find it dubious because we don’t have to prove that we have agency or
have held on to our humanity. If we are human, then that should have never
been a question. Moreover, agency does not mean resistance or rebellion—
just the capacity to act, for better or for worse. Drug dealers and slave
drivers have agency and humanity, especially in light of all the destruction
and havoc around the world caused by and in the name of humanity. Of
course, there is something edifying about celebrating our resilience and all
that business, but that stuff never appealed to me.
      I took up the study of everyday struggle to better understand and buttress
the social movements with which I was involved. I learned that the most
effective social movements develop organically and create agendas around
people’s actual needs and grievances, not according to Marxist or liberal
logics. I understood the study of these kinds of everyday forms of
resistance, survival, renewal, as diagnostic, intended as a measure of power
relations and a way to gauge the grievances of working people who might
not have other avenues through which to voice their concerns. The state’s
reactions to everyday struggles also tell us something about the workings of
power, and that is precisely the kind of knowledge we need to create better
strategies to contest White supremacy.
Do you see yourself as fighting White supremacy? If so, how do
you do it?
      Yes. For the last thirty-five years, I have tried to fight White supremacy
through my writing and speaking, in the various organizations I have
supported over the years, from the Black Radical Congress and the
Labor/Community Strategy Center to the Movement for Black Lives and
beyond. But we need to be clear that removing all racial barriers, vigilantly
upholding antidiscrimination law, incorporating us into the system, and
replacing White authority with Black and Brown faces is not the same as
dismantling White supremacy. We should know by now that the state and
the dominant class have no problems granting Black people and other
aggrieved “minorities” recognition and incorporating them into the existing
state apparatus. We’ve watched this happen over the course of the last four
decades, at least, resulting in Black CEOs like Franklin Raines contributing
mightily to the financial crisis of 2008; a Black president, a Black secretary
of state, and Black national security advisers who advance the US war aims
in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and virtually everywhere on the planet; the
right to same-sex marriage based on the same principles of marriage as a
property relation; and the right of people of color, women, and queer people
to kill and torture around the world.
And at least in my worldview, dismantling White supremacy is not
enough; liberation requires a lot more. As the Combahee River Collective
Statement, now four decades old, made crystal clear, we cannot wage an
assault on White supremacy without fighting to end patriarchy and
capitalism—its fetishism of commodities, its law of private property, its
gendered logics, bourgeois individualism, its culture, its state apparatus. I
know it is in vogue now to call racism “anti-Blackness” and to embrace a
politics that forecloses the possibility of cross-racial and international
solidarity, but I’m committed to resisting all forms of oppression, not just
anti-Black racism. I really identify with those women of the Congress of
Afrikan People in the late 1970s whose slogan—which they took from
Lenin’s essay “Soviet Power and the Status of Women” (1919)—called for
“the abolition of every possibility of oppression and exploitation.”

## I Fight White Supremacy by Being Apocalypse-Ready

## Mia Birdsong

When I was pregnant with my first child, my husband and I moved from
the Bay Area to the Round House—a beautiful, funky home on forty acres
off a dirt road in California’s Central Valley. It’s the house where my
husband was born, and living there meant our cost of living was low enough
for us to both stay home with our new kid. Surrounded by little more than
oak trees and cow pastures, I discovered that I am a city girl. But I also
discovered the satisfaction of living a less convenient life, one that requires
and inspires learning some basic self-sufficiency skills.
There is this thing that happens to some of us when we become parents:
we become paranoid as fuck. We worry about freak accidents injuring or
killing our kid, we worry about our own mortality. We start planning for the
worst. This is, of course, compounded when you are Black. While I never
had any indication that there were violent White supremacists anywhere
near us, being so far away from civilization freaked me out. Out in the
country, no one can hear you scream.
Shortly after our daughter was born, my husband, a musician, started
touring frequently. Every night he was gone, I would lie awake until I had
thought through what I’d do if the White supremacists came for us. I’d
probably hear them come up the driveway. They’d get in the house easily,
because there were no locks on the doors, but the dogs slept downstairs and
would keep them occupied long enough for me to strap my baby into the
sling and climb over the second-floor balcony. I would have to escape
through the woods, because the White supremacists would be blocking the
driveway with their trucks.
But country living and parenting didn’t just feed my fear. It also fed my
sense of freedom. I gardened in earnest for the first time, growing inedible
zucchini the size of my arm and hundreds of tomatoes that never ripened.
Those early mistakes taught me as much as my successes. I learned that
paying attention reveals what my garden needs and when it needs it. I
learned that sometimes a little hardship creates studier plants, and that
sometimes you need to cut back to encourage growth.
During the two years we lived there, I apprenticed with my mother-inlove, a brilliant midwife. Accompanying her to prenatal visits and births
was mind-blowing. I had read midwifery books, but observing and
supporting a master showed me the depths of knowledge and artistry it takes
to guide, but not disrupt, a process that has a wide range of normal and
deeply connects us to our animal selves. Most importantly, it reminded me
that we are built for life. My brief apprenticeship did not make me a
midwife, but in an emergency, during the apocalypse, I could catch a baby.
During our country-living years, most days I spent hours walking the
land with my infant strapped to me, talking to her about the trees and birds.
The landscape was foreign to me, which made me both uncomfortable and
curious. I learned the names of the creatures and plants. Live oak, fly
catcher, ceanothus, California newt. In the morning, from our bedroom
window, I watched deer graze in the orchard. At dusk, I heard coyotes carry
on and saw bats catch insects. I became aware of the rhythms of the natural
world and realized that it was something I was a part of, not separate from.
And if I was part of it—if it was my habitat too—then I could survive in it.
In the summer, klamath weed, a pretty yellow-flowered plant, bloomed
in abundance. My mother-in-love told me it was also known as St. John’s
Wort, a plant I knew from the bouts of seasonal depression I experienced in
college. It had kept me from spiraling into the abyss during long Ohio
winters, and here it grew like a literal weed that I could harvest. I’d started
studying herbalism several years before, but this encounter shifted my
relationship to plants. I could make medicine. I remember thinking that if
the apocalypse came, I could help out with all the anxiety, panic, and
depression that would accompany it.
Since moving back to Oakland, my husband and I regularly talk about
who we’d circle up with, what we’d take with us, and how we’d get out if
society fell apart. I recently took up archery with my second child, in part
because it’s fun, but also because during the apocalypse, when all the
bullets are gone, we still have to defend ourselves and eat.
I have maintained the curiosity that inspires me to know how to do
things that support collective self-sufficiency. In our little backyard, I grow
food and medicinal herbs. I took up beekeeping after a swarm of the honey
producers landed in our yard on my birthday a few years ago. I care for a
flock of six chickens.
Home invasion preparation and escape planning came from a place of
fear. Gardening, beekeeping, midwifery, and my nascent archery practice
are all practical skills that I can tap when the crisis is over and we need to
rebuild. But they also keep me fully living now. When I’m pulling frames
full of honey out of a hive or loosing an arrow, I must be totally present.
Planting seedlings and sitting with a laboring pregnant person invites a kind
of in-touchness that deepens my ability to be alert and aware of the rhythms
of my surroundings. That’s good in an emergency and for long-term staying
alive—now and post-apocalypse.
Knowing that I have skills to bring to our survival when shit goes down
gives me a sense of security when my news feed is full of Black death and
so many of us are struggling to make ends meet and stay healthy.
I went into fall of 2015 feeling heavy. So many Black women in my orbit
had recently died, were dying, or had been diagnosed with a chronic illness.
Living at the intersection of patriarchy and White supremacy is traumatic.
Into that grieving walked Nwamaka Agbo, a restorative economics
practitioner, at a retreat the Movement Strategy Center held in Oakland.
During a break, she and I walked around Lake Merritt and we talked about
the ways we saw the double-edged sword of Black women’s strengths,
ingenuity, brilliance, and excellence result not just in achievement and
survival, but illness, disease, trauma, and death. All the exceptionalism,
doing it ourselves if we want it done and making a way out of no way, came
at a cost.
We also recognized that we, and the amazing Black women we knew,
were helping White supremacy and patriarchy out by not caring for
ourselves enough, by not dealing with our historical and lived trauma, by
not examining deeply enough the ways in which we internalize racism and
sexism.
We shouldn’t have to do all that work. But in this too, no one is coming
to save us. We knew we wanted to create a solution that would help heal us,
and we wanted to start from a place of joy, with our eyes on freedom,
because while it is key, healing is not the end goal—liberation is. It took us
almost a year to start (because it is challenging for Black women to
prioritize ourselves), but that conversation birthed Black Women’s Freedom
Circle. On a sunny day in August, twenty-plus Black women met at my
house for three hours to nourish our bodies and spirits, to connect with and
witness each other.
We each identified a time or practice that made us feel free. We
discussed what that feeling was and how we could expand it beyond the
moment we’d identified. We agreed that the exploration of freedom was
imperative not only to our own personal well-being but to our collective
emancipation.
Like most people, I imagine the apocalypse as a disaster (nuclear war,
earthquake, environmental catastrophe, government collapse, zombies). My
mind is full of all the dystopian possibilities I’ve absorbed from science
fiction TV, movies, and books. And in a world that hates Black women,
where the state is not designed to care for or protect us, I feel some
imperative to be able to care for and protect myself and my loved ones. But
I also understand the apocalypse as an opportunity for renewal. A world
shaken off its foundation can be built differently, better. But we have to hold
a vision of what future we really want so as not to re-create the messes we
have now. As Lucille Clifton made clear, “We cannot create what we can’t
imagine.” Freedom from oppression is not a linear path we travel toward the
future. It is something that has to exist inside each of us—a moment that we
can repeat, a spark we can fan into fire.
Black Women’s Freedom Circle has been gathering regularly since we
started. We have talked about anger, grief, safety, family, intimacy, and
purpose. We laugh and weep and hold expansive space for all our feelings
and experiences. We do witchy shit and research internet security. We circle
up to make real the world we want to live in.
This too is being apocalypse-ready.

On Restoring Our Humanity in a World That Wishes Us Dead

## Wazi Maret

My spirituality, sense of self, and ability to remain soft are my greatest
weapons here in a world that has tried to kill me.
Fighting White supremacy isn’t always by way of an action; I believe it
can also be an embodiment. In my case, it has required a complete rebirth of
and a reorientation to everything I was taught about life, including the
harmful messages I was fed from birth. Messages like: White is right. Blue
is for boys. Skirts are for girls. God loves us all unconditionally, but with
conditions. We are only worth as much as we can produce. These messages
taught me more about fear and the urge to control those who are different
than they taught me about love, acceptance, and appreciation.
White supremacy has an explicit history of using race as the basis to
inflict violence on Black people and rob us of our humanity. But it took me
a long time to realize just how insidious it is, how malleable. It thrives on
disconnection—from nature, from each other, and from ourselves. It thrives
on exploitation of the land, culture, ideas, and labor. It uses fear to separate
us via racism, classism, transphobia, homophobia, sexism, ableism, and
xenophobia.
I believe, then, that fighting White supremacy requires getting more
curious, saying yes to all that I have been taught to fear, reconnecting to my
body and presence, and developing everyday practices that will contribute
to my personal well-being and healing. It requires saying yes to myself
every single day.
I have been harmed by many things in this world because of the
identities and experiences I’ve inherited. I am a Black man, I come from a
working-class and mixed-race family, I am queer, I am transgender, I am
incredibly soft, sometimes I find myself somewhere in between genders, and
many days I am afraid to walk through the world visibly. I also know that I
have a little more freedom and safety to exist only because Black trans
women made it possible by saying yes to themselves unapologetically.
White supremacy has created a world conditioned to fear and hate Black
trans people, to shun us when we express ourselves outside rigid gender
roles, to dispose of us when we cause discomfort in others, to contain us
when we have become too free, to punish us when we resist. It draws
strength from the trauma it creates, which has haunted our communities for
generations. If I am to resist all of this, then, my mandate is to pledge a deep
commitment to healing myself as a Black queer trans man and investing in
the healing and empowerment of other Black trans people.
I fight White supremacy through an outpouring of love for Black people.
I fight by reclaiming my body and affirming my gender identity, my gender
expression, and all of my authentic selves no matter how different it was
before. I fight by reclaiming my breath, by taking time to slow down and
notice, feel, and understand the sensations I encounter and all the things my
body does to support me in staying alive.
I resist through meditating, reading books, reclaiming my mind,
remembering that what I was taught as a child is not the whole story.
Because White supremacy encourages us to remain ahistorical, I resist by
reconnecting to my ancestors and lifting up the narratives of those whose
stories were intentionally omitted. I resist through creating—art, music,
fashion—because I know that capitalism and White supremacy stifle
creativity and encourage conformity, efficiency, and production for the sole
sake of building wealth for a few.
I resist by establishing boundaries and maintaining them with dignity, by
knowing that I have agency over my body, my life, and how I choose to live.
I honor vulnerability and femininity because White supremacy has taught us
to police and dishonor women and femmes. I trust Black women, especially
Black trans women. I talk to my friends and family about White supremacy
and how we can all do something about it. I build relationships with other
men and seek to foster healing from toxic masculinity and patriarchy, and I
encourage us to hold ourselves—and each other—more accountable.
Ultimately, I believe that fighting White supremacy means restoring my
own sense of humanity and connecting to the humanity in others. This
requires a great deal of healing and empathy for each other’s unique
struggles. If I can take small steps toward healing myself—if we all can—
then we can heal ourselves collectively. To echo my comrades from Black
Lives Matter Atlanta and Southerners On New Ground, who said it best:
“The mandate for Black people in this time is to avenge the suffering of our
ancestors, to earn the respect of future generations, and be willing to be
transformed in the service of the work.”

## For Alicia Garza, the Future Is Dignified

As one of the cofounders of Black Lives Matter, Alicia Garza’s name is
synonymous with harnessing the power of social media to organize and
advocate on behalf of Black people in real life. But she was fighting for us
long before the masses discovered her Twitter handle, and she is committed
to creating a world that will sustain us long after the concept of hashtags has
faded from our collective memory. As the principal at Black Futures Lab,
the Oakland native is constructing freedom dreams writ large, and she
knows it will take all of us to get there. Here she talks strategy with Kenrya.
In one sentence, what do you do?
I’m an organizer, I’m a strategist, and I’m a freedom dreamer.
Dope. Can you please tell me how you came to be an organizer?
I grew up in the Bay Area, born to a single mom who, at the time, had a
different plan for what her life was going to look like. When I came onto the
scene, she had to quickly figure out how to pivot. Part of what that meant
was that she put on her big girl panties and be like, “Okay. I have to make
some different choices around what it means to bring a baby girl into the
world.”
Coming up, my lifestyle was really influenced by the way my mother
hustled. She worked three jobs, and she did that to take care of me. She was
raising me, initially, with her twin brother, who moved out to California to
support her. She worked during the day, he worked at night, and somewhere
in between there, when everyone else was taken care of, she pursued her
own dreams. When people ask me, “How did you get into this work?” the
answer is that I’m definitely my mother’s child.
Part of how she has shaped me is that she is someone who is not an
activist—she’s not even really that political, to be honest—but she raised me
with a sense of right and wrong, that there’s a responsibility that I have to
leave the world better than I found it.
I got involved in activism at a young age. My first foray was around
reproductive justice, getting condoms and contraception into school nurses’
offices. It was a big conversation happening in my school district, and the
broader political context was that it was during Bush number one. This was
when the right wing really started taking power in this country. There was a
big fight over abstinence-only education versus comprehensive sex health
education and access to contraception, and that sat inside of a context of
what the administration was promoting at the time as “family values,”
which you and I both know was really a way to move a White, male,
Christian agenda.
As a single mom, my mother talked to me a lot about sex. There was no
stork, you know what I’m saying? She was like, “Look, check this out. Sex
makes babies and babies are expensive, okay?” She really wanted me to
understand the dynamics that come with being able to make decisions on
your own behalf with information that helps you do that in a holistic way.
My entry point was around advocacy and service, and it wasn’t until
college that I started learning and understanding organizing. Since that
awakening, I got trained here in Oakland in the art and science of
organizing, and I started knocking on doors in East and West Oakland
around issues of economic justice and racial justice. I worked at the
University of California Student Association for a little while, helping
students of color run and win campaigns on campus for equity and all that
good shit.
I spent ten years in a grassroots organization in San Francisco fighting
for Black people. The year I left that organization was the year that we
started Black Lives Matter.
So we know your origin story. Now tell me about the beginning
of Black Futures Lab.
The origin story of the Black Futures Lab starts in 2016. Being one of
the cocreators of Black Lives Matter, that was probably one of the hardest
years for me personally and politically. It was almost like you could see the
storm coming: BLM starts in 2013. Ferguson happens in 2014, and there’s
this catalytic series of uprisings that signals a rupture in Black communities,
in Black movements, and in Black freedom dreams. This period has really
exposed both how Black people are always moving toward a different level
of humanity and how there are big gaps and tensions that have really shaped
what we think is possible for us.
And 2016 was predictable in some ways. It was the first major election
after the first Black president in the history of this country was elected, and
so obviously there was going to be a backlash. Then there was the weird
positioning from the Democratic Party. It was scary to think about how
there would be an extension of the kind of pandering that normally gets
done to Black people during election cycles, but that instead it would be
shaped around this movement moment and used in incredibly problematic
ways.
We were in an untenable position. You have movement and protest
happening. You have people pushing an agenda, and then you have an
election cycle where there’s really a choice around what you take on as your
platform and your vision for the future of the country. What became really
clear was that there was no vision from any candidate for what could be
possible for Black America. There was a vision for the middle class,
corporations, and White nationalists, but there was not a vision for how we
move the needle around Black wellness, dignity, and citizenship conceived
of in a broad way.
At the same time, we were in a position where candidates wanted to be
in proximity to us, but weren’t committed to building power with us. The
electoral system itself is not designed for that, but that doesn’t mean we
shouldn’t push for that. What I realized was that there was no way to have
that happen unless Black people build political power that is independent
and progressive and clear about the tensions and challenges of the electoral
system, and also committed to wielding whatever tools are necessary to
build the power we deserve.
That is really where the Black Futures Lab comes from. I always use the
metaphor of being on a roller coaster that is absolutely batshit crazy and
you’re regretting you got on the thing in the first place. You’re like, “I’m
never going to make it.” At some point in that process you have to imagine
what could happen if you did make it. For me, in holding on tight to that
roller coaster, I did a lot of dreaming. If this wasn’t so wack, what would we
be doing? What could we do in better circumstances to make this process
work for us as much as it can? What else needs to be built to both challenge
the system as it is and figure out how to leverage some of the utility of these
systems?
The Black Futures Lab comes from that. It’s a freedom dream geared
toward transforming Black communities in the constituencies that build
independent Black political power in cities and states. It is aware of our
current political context, but it is not hamstrung by it. It recognizes that the
problems our communities face are complex and that we need to
experiment, innovate, and build political power. We can’t cede control over
what should be democratic systems to people who don’t want democracy.
We can’t just look at it and say, “Well, those people don’t want
democracy, so I’m not fucking with it.” We actually have to say, “It’s ours
and we’re going to fight for it.” We have a number of different things that
we’re doing, but all of them are geared toward reimagining what Black
governance looks like, reimagining what democracy for Black communities
looks like, and having a clear vision of what it means for Black
communities to have power.
What does that transformation, that reimagining, look like to
you?
We have a pretty clear sense of what power looks like. It’s the ability to
make decisions for your own life and the lives of people you care about. It’s
the ability to shape the narrative of who you are, what you deserve. Power is
about being able to implement rewards and consequences based on your
agenda. And power is also very much about being able to lead everyone,
whether or not they’re in line with your agenda.
I think having that understanding of power then means that we have a
different understanding of what we need to do to get it. The big thing that is
critical for us at the Lab is that we understand that we need to get more
proficient in how and when we build alliances and also understand that
those coalitions need to include people who don’t agree with us on every
issue and people who might generally share our vision for what’s possible,
but have different approaches on how to get there.
If we think about all the people who need to be united to achieve what
we deserve, there has to be an incredible diversity within that if we are
really talking about building a new democracy. I mean, democracy doesn’t
mean everybody’s on the same page, it means that everybody gets to
participate in those decisions. And then leadership and organizing are about
building a movement that is moving toward your agenda. That’s what it
looks like and feels like to us.
How does the Black Census Project move the needle toward
that transformative vision of Black power?
We kicked off the launch of Black Futures Lab with that project because
we think Black communities are incredibly misunderstood on the left and in
the center. Our hypothesis inside the Lab is that the demographics of Black
communities are changing very rapidly, but our strategies to engage those
changes haven’t caught up. What does it mean that Black people in the
United States are increasingly migrant? What does it mean that Black
people in the United States are increasingly openly lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and gender-nonconforming? What does it mean to really listen
to what Black people in rural areas are experiencing?
The Black Census Project is a way to reshape our strategies around
engaging and activating Black people by saying, “Actually, Black people are
not a monolith. Black people in the United States are all kinds of things, and
that shapes our perception of what’s happening to us, for us, and about us,
and it also shapes our vision for what we want to see.” Our prediction is that
in talking to two hundred thousand Black people across the country from
very diverse places, we’ll not only expose that Black people are not a
monolith, but we’ll also be able to identify opportunities for deeper
organizing and learn what is necessary for Black dignity and wellness.
Our goal is to use that data to change the way the institutions engage our
communities and send up a flare that we intend to contend for power. And
we hope that this project also helps to build the capacity of our movement;
most of us don’t talk to two hundred thousand Black people. Hopefully, this
data will also sharpen the ways we engage our own communities and help
identify new possibilities for collaboration and coordination, which is also
necessary for the movement that we need to build.
How does your work with Black Futures Lab help Black people
dismantle the system of White supremacy?
We see ourselves as a capacity builder for Black communities. We are
not a mass organization that people become members of. That is important
work, but it’s a different kind of work. We are building our people’s
capacity to govern and lead. And governance and leadership are about
solving problems for Black folks, proposing what a different world should
look like, and putting Black people in charge of changing systems,
structures, and institutions to meet that agenda.
What does freedom for all Black people look like to you?
For me, freedom looks like being able to have dignity. For me, that word
and that vision are really important. We could provide a whole litany of the
policies we need to change, but for me all that adds up to is: Can Black
people live full and dignified lives? Can we live in a way that is cooperative
and not predatory? Can we bring our full selves everywhere that we are? I
believe very deeply that not only is it possible, but it’s necessary for this
planet to survive. It’s my goalpost.
What do you want your legacy to be?
If I’m lucky, my legacy will be that I contributed to energizing and
activating a whole shit ton of people to fight like hell for our dignity and we
won some shit that was pretty important.

## QUESTION, ANSWERED

Here we share our own dreams by answering the question: what does
freedom look like to you?

## Kenrya

There is a playground that sits beside my daughter’s school. It’s nothing
special, just a play structure, surrounded by wood chips that are the bane of
my existence on Saturdays, when I’m forced to pluck them out of her socks
before I can toss them into the washing machine. But one of my favorite
things is to watch Saa overwhelm the structure. She stomps to the top, flips
her entire body over the rod that crowns the tallest slide, does some parkourtype shit off the fireman’s pole on the far side, climbs up the other side
upside down like some kind of fucking ninja, jumps off the ledge when it’s
time to choreograph a step with her girls—she devastates that thing. And
she does it with a wide grin, a loud laugh, and shouts of “look, Mama,”
excited by the time she gets to run and jump and flip, empowered by the
strength and agility of her body.
As I watch her I realize that there, tangled in those beige bars, she is
immensely free. She’s not thinking about the mean thing her so-called
friend said to her at recess, or how long it will take her to run through her
violin practice that night, or how annoying it is that Mama is gonna wash
her hair before bed. She’s not just living in the moment, she is reveling in it,
being her entire self.
There are so few moments that Black people get to experience that type
of freedom. The type of freedom where you’re not calculating (and laughing
inside at) how “reverse racist” the other moms on the playground think you
are when you tell them you’re writing a book about dismantling White
supremacy. The type of freedom where you’re not forced to push back
against the gaslighting that comes when you tell the administration that
you’re pulling your child out of their school because a group of White and
White-aspiring kids touched her gorgeous fluffy hair and laughed at it. The
type of freedom where you don’t feel a twinge of trepidation the first time
you decide not to code-switch when it’s your turn to speak at the parent
association meeting.
In my freedom dream, I get to walk around this earth being my complete
self at all times without having to worry about someone trying to kick me
out of a restaurant because I complained about poor service. I get to call the
police when someone majorly harms me without having to worry that the
officers will kill me within two seconds of arriving. I get to send my
daughter to school without having to worry that she will be suspended for
the same minor offense that her White peer was let off the hook for.
We’re not there yet.
But I know a place where we can be our whole, free, Black-ass selves
right now: group text.
In my group texts with my closest friends, I don’t have to censor myself.
I can share my deepest concerns, celebrate my successes, talk shit about
people, and reveal how clueless I am about what’s happening on the lust and
Soundcloud beats shows.
And I’m not the only one. Those blue bubbles pop up all day, as my girls
share funny tweets, impressive famous dick prints, and rants that we can’t
share online ’cause jobs and oppression and trolls and respectability politics
and shit.
In the spirit of getting us all free, here are some actual messages that
## *
appear in my group texts; names have been omitted to protect the shady.
A: Question: Do you think one can truly fight for something they may not
have experienced? Is it off principle? Or do people truly only fight for things
they’ve experienced? Things meaning injustices, abuse, etc.
B: Yes. It sounds like an easy question, but maybe I’m not thinking of it
right.
A: I mean, what does it mean to fight? Can you just say you agree with the
cause, or do you have to be out front doing the fighting? Or is it enough to
just put money out to help the cause? I don’t know. Just some craziness I
was thinking about when Jay-Z was talking about racism.
C: I say no. I guess it’s the difference between sympathy and empathy.
A: He’s experienced it. I’ve experienced it, but I don’t know if everybody
has truly experienced it. Like sometimes people give textbook answers of
how they would handle it, but it’s not always the way you can handle it.
B: Oh, so you are asking if people that haven’t experienced racism and
sexism can truly fight?
A: Yes.
B: I think they can, but it’s important to note that fighting can look like
different things.
A: That’s true.
B: And I think it’s important because Black people aren’t gonna be the ones
to fix racism. It’s White folks. A racist dude ain’t listening to my Black ass.
They will listen to someone who looks like them.
C: Wait. Fight is an action. Yes, people can fight for or against things they
haven’t experienced. I think people can feel bad for people in a situation.
But do they feel the pain? Not the same way.
B: Same with sexism, it’s really gonna take men pulling each other up.
C: I’m not gay. I can march for gay rights, but I can’t feel their struggle.
B: This is a broad generalization—I know the fight is more nuanced.
A: I mean, I guess what I’m asking is just because I show up, do I get credit
for fighting for the cause? I’m a number, but what am I doing after that
march?
C: Sometimes you just need numbers. *shrugging Black girl emoji*
A: Does fighting or standing up for something mean you do it every day or
every chance you get or just that one time or whenever it happens to come
across you?
B: I think so. ’Cause a lot of people won’t even do that.
A: That’s true. I mean I was just thinking, Do I fight for anything? Like, I
try to stand up for people when I see them wronged, but do I really fight for
stuff? Why don’t I? Is it because I’ve been conditioned to fall in line and not
ruffle the norm? I don’t know. Is it because I was raised in the South?
B: Do what you can. You can’t fight everything, so do what you can.
A: “She. Is. Playing. Taylor. Swift. In. My. Car. Can I toss her out?”
A: *Pastes in screenshot of an email sent to an annoying coworker.*
A: I sent this and now I feel like I was a little too angry Black woman in it.
B: It’s clear. Was this a repeat issue? Clear meaning, the message was given
clearly.
A: Fuck yes. I’m so frustrated with them. But I always try not to be a bitch
via email.
B: Not angry Black woman, but annoyed about something you explained
before. I don’t think it was bitchy.
C: No. You were direct. Especially if you were clear in your previous email
that no action was required.
A: I need new underwear. My booty eats all my draws.
A: I’m not sure why I’m feeling annoyed by the news talking about the girl
Jholie Moussa, the teen who went missing and they found her body. They
keep showing pics of her that are… provocative. Did she not have any pics
where she’s not licking her lips or looking back at it?
B: It’s what they do.
C: *brown finger pointing upward emoji*
A: It’s really blowing me. They showed a scholarly pic of Natalee Holloway.
And let’s be clear, she was being hot in the ass in Aruba. Didn’t deserve any
harm! But she wasn’t a scholar on sabbatical. She was a teen.
C: Sadly, that’s the norm in media. White supremacy touches everything.

*sad downcast face emoji*

A: Maybe I’m cranky, but adult-ass women who wear chokers bother the
hell outta me.
B: Lmao.
A: *Pastes in link to article: “Under Ben Carson, HUD Scales Back Fair

## Housing Enforcement”*

B: He is a disgrace. Damn sellout.
C: I’ve been watching eight minutes of Jerry Springer, watching these two
women fight and cuss over a man. They brought this nigga out and I
chuckled so hard. He looks like a baby roach! And yes, Ben Carson is a
disgrace.
A: *Pastes in link to article: “WATCH: Big Daddy Kane Gets ‘Raw’ for

## Tiny Desk Concert”*

A: He. Can. Still. Get. It.
B: I love his old ass.
A: Love him!
A: Nigga.
A: Starbucks hired every high-powered Black attorney for help with the
Blacks. They couldn’t afford to lose us as patrons or workers. I appreciate
the effort if nothing else.
B: They are doing this right. They are definitely trying hard.
A: *Pastes in surreptitiously snapped picture of adorable, clearly freezing
newborn baby sitting in a car seat on the floor beside their mama*
A: White. People. This woman has on a winter coat. But she brings her
newborn into the pediatrician office in a sleeper. No blanket. WTF??? This
baby was just born. Like days old.
B: If you cold, that baby is cold. White. People.
A: Looking for gift ideas. Z’s line is celebrating their anniversary, and I
want to get them a gift from the wives. I was thinking this personalized flask
and cigar case. But one of them is super religious.… Do you guys have
another idea?
B: Tell that churchy muthafucka to chill and put pineapple juice in that
flask.
C: It’s so perfect! I want one.
A: Did y’all watch the Black-ish episode about Howard? Why did people
like it? I hate it. It basically portrayed HBCUs poorly saying the kids that go
there have a hard time adjusting to White folks in the workplace and are not
exposed to White life.
B: I didn’t like that either.
C: Same here. I wasn’t a fan. I think This Is Us did it so damn perfectly
anyone else would have fallen short.
A: Yup.
D: Yeah, I was upset the whole HU episode too. No one is out of the loop
these days, and fuck knowing a White song.
A: Sista… you’ve been on my mind. Oh, sista… we’re two of a kind.
Sooooo, sista! *tilted crying laughing face emoji*
A: Am I missing something? This State of the Union is an entire speech of
shout-outs. It’s like one long-ass BET award acceptance speech. He’s trash.
B: Ugh. Yeah, not watching that.
A: I know. I need to stop.
C: He’s horrible at this!! He’s sounding out each syllable. This is stupid!!!!
A: You know he searched high and low for Black people.
C: Locking the door on Dreamers to stop gang murder is like killing all
White men to stop serial killing. This is insane.
A: I need to stay home today. My PTSD is flaring. My cousin got stopped
twice this week coming home from work. Why is it okay for Black people
to deal with this shit constantly????
A: “She clearly doesn’t have any real friends. Why the hell did she tweet
that instead of posting in her group text?”

I never learned how to jump double dutch. I have blamed this fact on my
pigeon toes and bow legs. (“My feet point inward, my legs bend backwards.
I can’t not step on the rope.”) I’ve gone as far as invoking an undiagnosed
spatial problem. While I did manage to bust a blood vessel in my right eye
opening a closet door as a kid, the truth is that my double dutch fail comes
down to trust. I simply could not trust the inevitably screwface girls
whipping that white, hard plastic–coated laundry line to a wicked rhythm. I
sucked even when they were kind enough to designate me the “babydoll,”
the girl allowed to start in the center instead of jumping into already-turning
ropes from the side. I hated that—I had my first-grade pride.
But seriously, name me one thing that is more beautiful than double
dutch.
It is so very difficult for observer me to articulate what the end of White
supremacy looks like. I can’t tell you which set of policies, political
victories, and global shifts will vanquish this crazy-making system. But
what I can say is that the art and sport of double dutch offers some
possibilities.
For one, double dutch requires a deep synergy with other people. If
everyone is in sync, oh the tricks the jumper can do! But if you’re turning
double-handed or you’re in the center jumping too slow, the whole
enterprise falls apart.
The good thing about messing up in double dutch is that your mistakes
disappear with every round. You can be trash at 1:20 p.m. and kill it at
1:32 p.m., after a few other folks get a turn. The reason why you get
better doing the same thing isn’t because you’ve had a twelve-minute
emergency clinic. It’s because you and the people turning the ropes shift
how you work with one another. The democracy of rhythm takes hold.
Most double dutch takes place outside, in the sun, with Black girls in full
control of their arms, legs, and minds. They are sweating and counting. No
matter how absurd a sexual harasser is, he is not commanding girls to
replace their skills-related grimace with a coerced smile.
You cannot leave your body when you’re jumping or turning. The ropes
know.
Also, I have seen with my own eyes how Black children who are not cis
girls are welcome to learn and play double dutch. Outside of the game,
these kids may very well be castigated and abused for being who they are.
But within a double dutch context, they’re flying—or failing—alongside the
other people playing. It’s all about jumping and turning, not being one way
or another.
Try as you might, nobody can jump double dutch alone. And unless you
are the rare professional, your team is place-based. The people you struggle
with are in your neighborhood or schoolyard, or at your job where a group
of sisters decided that double dutch is some of the most fun cardio on the
earth.
    Of course, like everything everywhere, all the time, double dutch can be
problematic. Getting slapped in the face with a rope could happen. The
person turning could get a surge of bitter energy and speed up the tempo so
much that everyone is forced to quit. People can try to double the ropes to
make up for weak spots in the first one, but thicker ropes lead to thicker
welts. You can be a grown-ass woman like me who wishes that she’d
mastered it as a kid and sees her lack of skill as a cultural forgetting.
    But you can also be a grown-ass woman like me who is plotting on
joining, creating, or renewing her membership to a league of other adults
doing double dutch with varying degrees of skill, dreaming of a crew
turning and jumping together in the sun.

* And I added punctuation, ’cause this is a book, not a text message, you heathen. Also, the letters

just correspond to who spoke first, second, and so on. So don’t try to figure out a pattern—there isn’t
one, and you ain’t slick anyway.

to write hella honest essays. So much love to Ayana Byrd for being an
amazing friend and the best cheerleader a book could ever have, #GoBook!
The hugest of hugs to Norell Giancana for her expert wrangling. Thanks to
Shameeka Emanuel for showing me what happens when you live into what
God has for you. And my entire heart to my little, Saa Rankin Naasel, for
being both an inspiration and a star.

## Both of Us

Thanks to the Colorlines crew and publisher Race Forward, particularly

always made time. Thanks to her tireless associate Carol Taylor for getting
us together. And major thanks to Nation Books editorial assistant Kleaver
Cruz, and our peerless, never-scared editor, Katy O’Donnell. Katy, we are
incredibly lucky to have you.
