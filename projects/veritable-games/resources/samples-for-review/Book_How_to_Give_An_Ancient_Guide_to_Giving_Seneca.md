## INTRODUCTION

When was the last time you gave someone a gift? Perhaps it was on an
occasion when gifts are expected— a birthday, or wedding, or graduation.
Or perhaps you gave spon-taneously, “out of the goodness of your heart,” as
the expression goes. Perhaps you treated a date to a meal, or brought a
bottle of wine to a dinner party, or wrote a check to a charity or cause.

Probably you did not stop to consider the moral meaning of your action, or
fully appreciate the fact that, in the eyes of the Roman writer Seneca, you
were, in some small way, sav-ing the world. Your ability to give, as Seneca

## discussed in his treatise De Beneficiis, vii

## INTRODUCTION

or On Benefits, is an essential part of what makes you human, and if your
giving is done in the right spirit, it can even bring you close to the divine.

As a thinker of the Stoic school, Seneca saw a divine plan behind all human
activity, especially the giving of gifts and doing of favors. His philosophy
had strong under-pinnings in religious belief. He speaks of a

“Guiding Principle, from which things take their form” (1.6, on p. 23),
though he sometimes imagines this as composed of a plurality of beings, or
equates it with Nature or with the stars and planets. In the end, he claims at
one point (4.7, pp. 135–37), it’s not important what name we give to “the
first cause of all things,” whether we make it singular or plural, or whether
we per-sonify it, so long as we strive to follow the inner promptings it has

## instilled in us. The viii

## INTRODUCTION

impulse toward generosity, he maintains—

the “goodness of our hearts”— is foremost among these.

How does the human race survive, Seneca asks, lacking the speed, strength,
and ferocity of other animals? Only through our two unique attributes
(4.18): Reason and what Seneca calls societas, the social impulse, here
rendered “Fellowship” for want of a better translation. Our ability to help
one another, to pool our resources, to give, has elevated us above the wild
creatures that otherwise outstrip us, and indeed has made us masters of

creation. (Seneca was not well versed enough in the natural world to spot a
similar social impulse in other animals, and he knew little of the apes and
monkeys that share this trait with human beings.) In Seneca’s eyes, we did
not develop these abilities over time, as a modern ix

## INTRODUCTION

evolutionary biologist might claim. Our impulse toward generosity was
“hard-wired” from the start. We are meant to be generous beings, just as we
are meant to be virtuous in other ways, to employ reason to guide our
actions, and to prevent virulent emotions— anger in particular, as well as
fear, especially fear of death— from throwing our minds off course. These
are core principles of the Stoic school, explored by Seneca in the many
prose treatises and open letters he published throughout his life. (My two
other volumes in the “Ancient Wisdom for Modern Readers” series, How to
Keep Your Cool and How to Die, present Seneca’s thinking on the problem
of disruptive emotions— anger in the first case, fear of death in the second.)
In the treatise excerpted here, De Beneficiis, or On Benefits, Seneca sought
to x

## INTRODUCTION

strengthen the giving impulse and heighten our awareness of how much we
gain by following it, and how much we lose by ignoring or perverting it.
Selfishness, timidity, egoism, greed, and a dozen other failings, in Seneca’s
view, get in the way of our divine natures. We decline to give, or we give
badly, lording our gift over those who receive it, seeking renown for having
given, or expect-ing something in exchange, a return for our

“gift”— in that case a gift no longer, but something more like a loan, bribe,
or business transaction. On the other side of the gifting relationship, we
often also get badly, without the sense of gratefulness that makes us want to

be givers ourselves. Our ingratitude makes others less willing to give, and
the binding ties of societas begin to fray.

On Benefits is the longest of Seneca’s ex-tant essays, an indication of the
importance xi

## INTRODUCTION

he gave to its theme. He may well have added to it over time, for the last
three of its seven books have a very different tenor than the first four, and
the seventh book contains some off- topic material that feels like a later
accretion. Even after completing it, he still had more to say on the subject,
for he devoted one of his Moral Epistles to the same subject, characterizing
that letter as an extension and expansion of On Benefits. A portion of that
letter is included in this volume; its publication date is known to be 64 AD,
just before Seneca’s death. On Benefits might have been composed at any
point during the eight years before that, or perhaps over much of that time
span.

During all of those eight years, and indeed beginning slightly before (in 54
AD), Seneca lived a double life, composing philosophic essays and tragic
dramas, but also xii

## INTRODUCTION

serving as chief minister to Nero, ruler of Rome, whom he had tutored as a
youth.

Nero succeeded to the role of princeps, what we now generally term
“emperor,” at seventeen, an age at which he badly needed the advice and
moral authority of an older man. Seneca, a respected statesman, writer, and
thinker three times Nero’s age, provided the new regime with that authority.

Seneca worked closely with Nero for a decade, growing extremely wealthy
in the meanwhile, but as the partnership deteriorated (along with Nero’s
sanity), he found himself trapped. Though he offered to surrender his huge
estate, Nero (according to an account of his thinking set down by the
historian Tacitus) would not accept the bargain or permit him to depart the
palace.

Allowing Seneca to return what he had received, Nero reasoned (again in

## Tacitus’s xiii

## INTRODUCTION

account), would make the regime look predatory. After further
estrangement, in 65 AD, the emperor seized on ambiguous evidence to
accuse Seneca of treason and force him to commit suicide.

Because Seneca had gotten fabulously rich, quite possibly with the help of
Nero’s handouts, and then found it impossible to give back what he’d
accepted, the topic of gifts and giving held special meaning in his life. One
would not guess this from On Benefits, however. With a discretion born of
the perils of tyranny, Seneca kept his own life, and political career, offstage
in this treatise, as in almost all his other writings.

Even when he refers to “attendants of royal power” (2.5) who keep
petitioners waiting before dispensing favors, he gives no hint that he himself
was on most mornings surrounded by such petitioners, “clients”

## INTRODUCTION

( clientes) in Roman parlance, who needed imperial help and sought
Seneca’s support. Thus, Seneca’s paradoxical position at Nero’s court, a

powerful man capable of dispensing favors, but also a prisoner of those he
had received, underlies this text.

Just how much the life influenced the work is a matter of debate.

Rather than pursue that complex (and probably unanswerable) question, let
us take On Benefits on its own terms: as an ex-hortation toward generosity
and gratitude, not as a self- critique or self- defense from a man weighed
down by Nero’s gifts. Let us look to it for an expression of Seneca’s most
cherished beliefs: the certainty that a divine plan guided and protected the
human race, a plan established by benevolent gods; the conviction that the
fallibility of all human beings demands reciprocal clemency xv

## INTRODUCTION

and forgiveness; a sense of wonder at the world’s beauty and plenitude,
somehow coupled with a fear that it is descending into chaos (as in the grim
image of the besieged city and its pillagers at 7.27, put forward as

“a true picture of human life”). Above all, let us enjoy the rhetorical art of a
first- rate wordsmith: sweeping crescendos and soar-ing imagery,
kaleidoscopic shifts of tone and voice, and fiery verbal duels— Seneca’s
specialty— with imagined opponents, summoned out of the ether to serve
as foils and straw men.

Many of these pyrotechnics, however, present problems for the translator.
The difficulties in this case begin from the very title of the essay. De
Beneficiis is usually translated “On Benefits,” for lack of any other English
equivalent for Latin beneficium— a word that combines xvi

## INTRODUCTION

our notions of “gift,” “favor,” and “good turn.” In her extensive 2013 study
of the essay, Seneca on Society, classicist Miriam Griffin opined that

“benefit” is the only viable way to render beneficium, and at first I shared
that opinion . But not only is “benefit” ungainly, it also conjures up, for
American readers at least, the health and pension plans obtained through
employment contracts. The problem is compounded in that Seneca speaks
of beneficia constantly throughout the essay, so that the shortcomings of
“benefit” must be revisited over and over. In the end, I largely jettisoned the
word and adopted a wide array of alternatives: “gifts and good deeds,” most
commonly, but sometimes only one or the other, as well as “favor,”

“good turn,” “boon,” or the gerund “giving,” this last version especially
useful in xvii

## INTRODUCTION

passages where Seneca speaks of beneficium as an activity or a process.

As with all Seneca’s essays, the modern translator confronts the chauvinism
of the Greco- Roman world when dealing with gendered pronouns. Like his
contemporaries, Seneca addressed himself largely to males, on the
assumption that, since males dominated politics and statecraft, it was their
moral improvement that mattered most. His exemplars and hypothetical
actors are invariably male, to judge by the masculine gender of associated
Latin words. It seemed wrong to me to perpetu-ate this gender bias, but also
wrong, or at least anachronistic, to introduce female pronouns where Seneca
and his age would never have used them. I have dealt with this problem by
pluralizing many of Seneca’s singular pronouns, converting “he” either xviii

## INTRODUCTION

to “they” or “we,” or by using “you say” in cases where Seneca introduces
an unnamed opponent with inquit (“he/she says”).

This did not seem to me a distortion, since Seneca himself mixes first- ,
second- , and third-person statements, following no discernible pattern,
when making moral assertions or imagining responses of an inter-locutor.
Wherever a singular third- person pronoun seemed stronger or clearer than
the alternatives, I have chosen to preserve the masculine “he” of Seneca’s
admittedly patriarchal text.

The excerpts I have selected from On Benefits represent less than a quarter
of the entire essay. De Beneficiis was not only Seneca’s longest work but
also his most specific and thorough: much of it deals with highly specific,
even recondite problems of giving and receiving, of less interest to modern
xix

## INTRODUCTION

readers than its more far- reaching goals. In my selections, I have favored
the broadest, most inspirational passages of the work, especially those
dealing with the gods, for gods are crucial to Seneca’s thinking about
humanity.

The gods, according to Seneca—conceived here not as the Olympian deities
of mythology but as vague, impersonal forces— provide us with the
ultimate model of giving and doing good. The world they have provided is
beautiful and filled with nurture, even if we have made it into a chaos
resembling the sack of a captured city. They never withhold their generosity
and never expect a return. In their benevolence, they have instilled in us an
impulse to give—

“the goodness of our hearts”— that knits together the very fabric of
civilization. It is Seneca’s conviction that we have been xx

## INTRODUCTION

blessed by the divine, expressed sometimes in the ecstatic tones of a pulpit
preacher, that, I hope, will bring his teachings home to modern readers and
prompt deeper reflections about what we do when we give.

xxi

## HOW TO GIVE

## DE BENEFICIIS

## ON BENEFITS

As with all his works, Seneca addressed On Benefits to a single friend or
family member— in this case, a man named Aebutius Liberalis, about whom
almost nothing is known. Perhaps his name, which includes the word
liberalis , “generous,” partly explains why Seneca directed this essay to
him.

In any case, the idea of a single addressee is largely a fictional conceit, as
Seneca clearly wanted to be read widely by the general public.

Seneca begins his discussion of giving and receiving with a loose collection
of introductory thoughts, many of which touch on his central themes: giving
is not like 1

## DE BENEFICIIS

[1.1] Inter multos ac varios errores temere inconsulteque viventium nihil
propemo-dum, vir optime Liberalis, dixerim, quam quod beneficia nec dare
scimus nec accipere. Sequitur enim, ut male conlocata male debeantur; de
quibus non redditis sero querimur; ista enim perierunt, cum darentur. Nec
mirum est inter plurima maximaque vitia nullum esse frequentius quam
ingrati animi. Id evenire ex causis pluribus video.


## ON BENEFITS

lending, since no return should be expected or demanded; gratitude is
essential, but ingratitude should be pardoned; intention and attitude are
central aspects of generosity; we should emulate the gods in our
openhandedness. After this sweeping overview, Seneca gets down to a more
rigorous set of teachings in chapter 5 (p. 177).

[1.1]1 Among many and various mistakes made by those who live
heedlessly and recklessly, my most excellent Liberalis, I can name few
things more egregious than this: We don’t know how to give and receive.

The result is that the gifts we have given badly become total losses. By the
time we complain about not being repaid, it’s too late; they were already
lost at the moment they were given. And it’s hardly a surprise that among all
our greatest and most numerous vices, none are more common than 3

## DE BENEFICIIS

Prima illa est, quod non eligimus dignos, quibus tribuamus. Sed nomina
facturi diligenter in patrimonium et vitam debitoris inquirimus, semina in
solum effetum et sterile non spargimus: beneficia sine ullo dilectu magis
proicimus quam damus.

Nec facile dixerim, utrum turpius sit infi-tiari an repetere beneficium; id
enim genus huius crediti est, ex quo tantum recipiendum sit, quantum ultro
refertur; decoquere vero foedissimum ob hoc ipsum, quia non opus est ad
liberandam fidem facultatibus sed animo; reddit enim beneficium, qui debet.

Sed cum sit in ipsis crimen, qui ne con-fessione quidem grati sunt, in nobis
quoque est. Multos experimur ingratos, plures facimus, quia alias graves
exprobratores exactoresque sumus, alias leves et quos paulo post muneris
sui paeniteat, alias 4

## ON BENEFITS

those that arise from an ungrateful heart.2

The causes of this, as I see it, are multiple.

First, we don’t select worthy recipients when we give. By contrast, when we
set out to lend,3 we look into the estate and life-style of the borrower; when
planting, we don’t scatter seeds onto worn- out, sterile soil. Yet we strew our
gifts without any discernment, rather than give them.

I couldn’t easily say whether it’s worse to reject what one has received or
demand back what one has given. The nature of this kind of transaction is
that we must accept only that which is freely offered. A bankruptcy is
shameful if one seeks to clear one’s accounts only by financial means and
not by good intent. It’s those who feel in-debted who’ve repaid.

The fault lies not only in those who won’t even admit to a sense of gratitude,
but also 5

## DE BENEFICIIS

queruli et minima momenta calumniantes; gratiam omnem corrumpimus
non tantum postquam dedimus beneficia, sed dum damus.

Quis nostrum contentus fuit aut leviter rogari aut semel? Quis non, cum
aliquid a se peti suspicatus est, frontem adduxit, vultum avertit,

properantes elusit, in angusto vero conprensus aut distulit, id est timide

## ON BENEFITS

in ourselves. We find many ingrates, but we make more; we are sometimes
harshly demanding and critical, sometimes flighty and regretful of our gift
just after we give it, sometimes quarrelsome and prone to pick fights over
tiny things. Thus, we ruin all sense of gratitude, not just after we give but
even while we are giving.

Who among us was ever content to respond to a request made casually or
only once? Who, when supposing that something was being asked of him,
did not knit the brow, turn away the face, pretend to be busy, and, with long
conversations that strive never to find an end, deprive the asker of the
chance to make a request, dodging pressing needs by diverse ploys? Or,
when backed into a corner, who did not delay (which is only a cowardly
form of refusal), or promise to do it, but grudgingly, with 7

## DE BENEFICIIS

careret, dedit? Errat, si quis sperat respon-surum sibi, quem dilatione
lassavit, expectatione torsit. Eodem animo beneficium debetur, quo datur, et
ideo non est neglegenter dandum. Sibi enim quisque debet, quod a nesciente
accepit. Ne tarde quidem, quia, cum omni in officio magni aestimetur dantis
voluntas, qui tarde fecit, diu noluit; utique non contumeliose. Nam cum ita
natura comparatum sit, ut altius iniuriae quam merita descendant et illa cito

defluant, has tenax memoria custodiat, quid expectat, qui offendit, dum
obligat? Satis adversus illum gratus est, si quis beneficio eius ignoscit.


## ON BENEFITS

furrowed brow, with bitter words barely forced out between clenched teeth?
But no one willingly repays what was not received but extorted.

Can anyone be grateful when facing one who haughtily did him a favor or
tossed him a gift, or angrily shoved it at him, or gave it wearily, simply to be
rid of the bother?

It’s wrong to think that someone’s going to give back after being worn down
by delay and tortured by anticipation. Gifts and good deeds are returned in
the same spirit in which they’re given, and so must not be given heedlessly.
Those who get something given thoughtlessly think their debt is only to
themselves. And gifts must not be given tardily: In every kind of service, we
value the willingness of the giver, and those who delay will seem to be un
willing.


## DE BENEFICIIS

[1.1.9] Non est autem, quod tardiores faciat ad bene merendum turba
ingratorum.

Nam primum, ut dixi, nos illam augemus; deinde ne deos quidem
immortales ab hac tam effusa nec cessante benignitate sacrilegi
neglegentesque eorum deterrent. Utuntur natura sua et cuncta interque illa
ipsos munerum suorum malos interpretes iuvant.

Hos sequamur duces, quantum humana imbecillitas patitur; demus
beneficia, non feneremus. Dignus est decipi, qui de recipiendo cogitavit,
cum daret.


## ON BENEFITS

Gifts and good deeds must not be given with an edge of insult. It’s a pattern
in human nature that injuries get deeper under our skin than boons; they
take hold in our memory, while boons flow quickly away.

What can we expect if we give offense while doing a good turn? Merely to
be pardoned for such a gift would be gratitude enough.

[1.1.9] But the sheer proliferation of ingrates should not make us slow to be
generous. First, as I said, we increase their number. Second, not even the
immortal gods themselves are deterred from abundant and unceasing
kindness by the impious people who neglect them. They follow their own
natures; they give aid to all, even to those who are bad interpreters of their
gifts. Let’s follow their lead, insofar as our human obtuseness allows. Let’s
give, not lend out for profit. Those who think when 11

## DE BENEFICIIS

“At male cessit.” Et liberi et coniuges spem fefellerunt, tamen et educamus

decet!

Quae si quis non dat, quia non recepit, dedit, ut reciperet, bonamque
ingratorum facit causam, quibus turpe est non reddere, si licet. Quam multi
indigni luce sunt! tamen dies oritur. Quam multi, quod nati sunt, queruntur!
tamen natura subolem novam gignit ipsosque, qui non fuisse mallent, esse
patitur.

Hoc et magni animi et boni proprium est, non fructum beneficiorum sequi,
sed ipsa et post malos quoque bonum quaerere.

Quid magnifici erat multis prodesse, si nemo deciperet?

they give about what they will get in return deserve to be cheated of that
return.

## “But let’s say things turn out poorly.”4

Our children and our spouses have often disappointed us, yet we still marry
and raise them. Indeed, we’re so stubbornly tenacious, in defiance of
experience, that we go back to war after a defeat or to the sea after a
shipwreck. How much more fitting then to stay the course in giving!

If someone doesn’t give because he didn’t receive, then he only gave in
order to receive; he supplies the ingrates— whose vice is to avoid giving
back whenever possible— with just cause. How many are unworthy of the
sunshine, yet the day still dawns! How many complain of being born into
this world— yet Nature begets a new generation, and brings into being the
same people who would prefer not to have been.


## DE BENEFICIIS

[1.2.3] Beneficiorum simplex ratio est: tantum erogatur; si redit aliquid,
lucrum est, si non redit, damnum non est. Ego illud dedi, ut darem. Nemo
beneficia in calendario scribit nec avarus exactor ad horam et diem appellat.
Numquam illa vir bonus cogitat nisi admonitus a reddente; alioqui in
formam crediti transeunt. Turpis feneratio est beneficium expensum ferre.

Qualiscumque priorum eventus est, persevera in alios conferre. Melius apud
ingratos iacebunt, quos aut pudor aut occasio aut imitatio aliquando gratos
poterit efficere.


## ON BENEFITS

Here’s the mark of great and good hearts: To seek good deeds for their own
sake, not for the profits that flow from them, and to look for good people
even after meeting bad ones. What magnificence would there be in doing
good for many, if none of them ever took advantage?

[1.2.3] Accountancy of good deeds is a simple matter: A certain amount is
dispensed; if anything comes back, that’s a profit, but if not, it’s no loss. I
gave for the purpose of giving. No one writes down good deeds on a ledger
or calls them in by day and hour like a greedy collection agent.

A good person never thinks of them, unless reminded by the one making
return; to do otherwise is to make them into a loan.

It’s a base kind of usury to treat a gift as an account payable. Whatever has
happened in the case of prior gifts and good deeds, 15

## DE BENEFICIIS

non cura mitiget et in amorem sui vertat. Leonum ora a magistris impune
tractantur, elephantorum feritatem usque in servile obsequium demeretur

posita sunt, adsiduitas tamen meriti pertinacis evincit. Ingratus est adversus

Tertium etiam in eorum, quae exciderunt, memoriam reducet.

ungrateful, who might be made grateful at some point— by shame, by
opportunity, or by imitation of their betters.

Don’t give up; carry through with your job, fulfill the part of a good person.
Help this one with cash, that one with credit, another with influence,
another with advice, another with healthful teachings. Even wild beasts can
perceive the care of their keepers.

No animal is so beyond taming that nurture does not soften it and turn it
toward love of that which nurtures. Lions’ mouths are pulled open by their
trainers without harm, and food brings the elephant’s wildness to slavish
obedience; constant effort of devoted care wins over even those creatures
who have no understanding or appreciation of the gifts. Someone’s
ungrateful for today’s 17

He forgot both? A third will call back the memory of those that have slipped
away.

Those who are quick to think they have wasted good deeds will in fact waste
them.

But those who lean in, and add new good deeds to the first ones, will
squeeze out gratitude from even a hard and oblivious heart. The
beneficiaries won’t dare to lift their eyes in the face of so many good deeds;
wherever they turn to escape their awareness, let them see you standing
there.

Besiege them with benefits.

[1.5] I must now explain the first of the things we have to learn— namely,
what it is that we owe when someone’s given to us.

Some think they owe the money they’ve received; others, the political office;
others, the priesthood; others, the province. But these are only the markers
of giving, not the 19

in re carum atque pretiosum est, parvi pend-unt. Haec, quae tenemus, quae
aspicimus, in quibus cupiditas nostra haeret, caduca sunt, auferre nobis et

## ON BENEFITS

gifts themselves. Gifts and good deeds can’t be touched by the hand; they’re
enacted in the mind. Between the product of giving and the gift itself lies a
huge gulf. The gift is not the gold, or the silver, or any of those things we
think most important; it’s the very intent of the one who gives.

It’s the ignorant who take note only of those things that meet their eyes, that
can be passed down and owned, while giving little weight to that which is in
fact dear and precious. The things we hold in our hands and see with our
eyes, the things our desire fastens on, are frail; both Fortune and human
wrongs can take them away. But a gift or good deed endures, even after the
object, the vehicle through which it was given,5 has perished. It’s a virtuous
act. No power can render it meaningless.


## DE BENEFICIIS

eo, quod fit aut datur, consistit, sed in ipso dantis aut facientis animo.
Magnum autem esse inter ista discrimen vel ex hoc intellegas licet, quod
beneficium utique bonum est, id autem, quod fit aut datur, nec bonum nec
malum est. Animus est, qui parva extollit, sordida illustrat, magna et in
pretio habita dehonestat; ipsa, quae appe-tuntur, neutram naturam habent,
nec boni nec mali; refert, quo illa rector impellat, a quo forma rebus datur.

## ON BENEFITS

[1.6] What then are gifts and good deeds?

They’re generous acts, done in an eager and voluntary spirit, that bring joy,
and also reap joy, from the act of giving. It doesn’t matter what’s done or
given, but the attitude, since the gift is not the thing done or given, but lies
in the heart of the one who does or gives. You can understand the huge
difference between these things from this: A gift or good deed is certainly
good, but the thing that’s given or done is neither good nor bad. It’s the
heart that elevates little things, brightens dingy things, or casts into dishonor
what’s thought to be great and valuable. The objects of our yearning are in
themselves neutral, neither good nor bad in essence. It matters in what

direction the Guiding Principle, from which things take their form, directs
them. The gift is not the thing counted or handed over, just as it’s 23

## DE BENEFICIIS

impietatem, quamvis aras sanguine multo cruentaverint.

Si beneficia in rebus, non in ipsa bene faciendi voluntate consisterent, eo
maiora essent, quo maiora sunt, quae accipimus.

Id autem falsum est; non numquam enim magis nos obligat, qui dedit parva
magnifice, qui “regum aequavit opes animo,” qui exiguum tribuit sed
libenter, qui pauper-tatis suae oblitus est, dum meam respicit, qui non
voluntatem tantum iuvandi habuit sed cupiditatem, qui accipere se putavit
beneficium, cum daret, qui dedit tamquam numquam recepturus, recepit,
tamquam non dedisset, qui occasionem, qua prodes-set, et occupavit et
quaesiit. Contra ingrata sunt, ut dixi, licet re ac specie magna vide-antur,

not the sacrificial animals, even if they’re fat and gleaming with gold, that
form the honor paid to the gods, but rather the righteous and pious intent of
worshipers. The good fulfill religious duties with grain or a bowl of meal;
the bad cannot flee impiety, though they spill buckets of blood on the altars
with their sacrifices.

If gifts and good deeds consisted in things rather than in the intent to do
them, they’d be greater in proportion to the size of what we receive. But it’s
not so. Often the ones who put us more in their debt are those who gave
little but with a great spirit, who “in their heart made their wealth like that

of kings,”6 who handed out a small amount but did so gladly, who forgot
their own poverty while showing concern for mine, who had not only the
intention but the desire to lend help, who felt that they 25

got a gift when they gave one, who gave it with no thought of ever getting it
back, or who got it back with no thought of ever having given it, who both
sought out, then grabbed, the chance to help. Conversely, those “gifts” are
in fact ungenerous, even if they seem great in appearance and substance, if
they were either wrung from the givers or dropped thoughtlessly. More
welcome by far is what comes not from a full but a willing hand. “They
gave me only a little, but they were not able to give more.

What he gave was huge, but he took his time, delayed, and when he gave, he
sighed; he gave it in a superior manner, he spread the word of his gift, and
did not seek to please the one to whom he gave. His gift was not to me, but
to his own ostentation.”

let’s 27

“Recipe, non desidero; meo contentus sum.” Interim non reddere tantum
libet, quod acceperis, sed abicere.

Ex his, quae necessaria sunt, quaedam primum optinent locum, sine quibus
non possumus vivere, quaedam secundum, sine quibus non debemus,
quaedam tertium, sine quibus nolumus. Prima huius notae sunt: hostium

give what’s needed; then, what’s useful; third, what’s pleasing, especially
things that will endure. We must begin however with what’s needed, for we
conceive differently of things that preserve life than of those that embellish
it or provide for it. Things that we can easily do without, we can size up
with a discriminating eye, and can say about them: “Take it back, I don’t
want it; I’m content with what I have.” (Sometimes it’s pleasing not only to
give back but also to toss far from you the things you’ve received.)

From the things that are necessary, top priority goes to those without which
we can’t live; second, to those without which we ought not; third, [to] those
without which we wouldn’t want to. The first category includes things of
this sort: being rescued from the hands of enemies, or from the wrath of a

we can survive, but in such a way that death would be preferable, such as
freedom, virtue, and a sound mind. Next are the things that we hold dear by
reason of closeness, blood relation, familiarity, and long-standing custom,
such as children, spouses, household gods, and other things to which the
heart is so attached that we’d regard it as more grave to be separated from
these than from life.

Next come the useful things, diverse and wide- ranging in their content.
Here we’ll place money— not in excess, but enough for a healthful way of
life; here, honor, and advancement toward higher station (for those who
strive in that direction), since 31

nothing is more useful than to become useful to oneself.

The gifts and good deeds that remain come out of an overflowing
prosperity, such as makes people spoiled. In this category, we’ll seek to
make our gifts pleasing by timely presentation and by avoiding the
commonplace, by giving things that few people own (few at least in this era
or in this manner), or things that may not be precious in themselves but
become so because of the time, or place, they were given.

We should think about what we can give that will bring most pleasure in
future, what the owners will often bump into so that we’ll be in their
thoughts every time they’re in its presence. We’ll at least be careful not to
send any useless gifts, such as hunting gear to a woman8 or an old man, or
books to a simpleton, or nets9 to a scholar 33

send pleasing things, not to send something that will rebuke a person’s
failings, such as wine to a drunkard, or medicines to the sickly.

If it acknowledges a vice of the recipient, it starts to be a curse and not a
gift.

In the second book of On Benefits , Seneca expands on the point made in
book 1, that the attitude with which one gives is far more important than the
gift itself. He extends this idea to include receiving as well as giving,
commencing a long inquiry, continuing throughout the work, into the
importance of gratitude.

[2.1] Let us give in the same spirit with which we would want to receive—
above all, generously, promptly, with no hesitation.


## DE BENEFICIIS

Ingratum est beneficium, quod diu inter dantis manus haesit, quod quis

est a negante, qui dubitavit, nullamque iniit gratiam. Nam cum in beneficio
iucundissima sit tribuentis voluntas, quia nolentem se tribuisse ipsa
cunctatione testatus est, non dedit sed adversus ducen-tem male retinuit.
Multi autem sunt, quos liberales facit frontis infirmitas.

## ON BENEFITS

There’s no gratitude incurred by a gift that sticks for a long time to the
hands of the giver, or that someone seems pained to let go of and gives as if
tearing it away. Even if some delay intervenes, let’s by all means avoid
seeming to think things over. The one who hesitates is nearly refusing, and
does not earn any gratitude. Since the intention of the person giving is the
most pleasant part of the gift, and since the giver reveals by hesitation an
unwillingness to give, he didn’t make a gift so much as lose a battle with
someone drawing it out of him. Many indeed are generous only when
weakness makes them submissive.

It’s the gifts and good deeds standing in readiness that are most pleasing,
the easy and voluntary ones, where no delay is seen except through the
modesty of the receiver.

wants; next best, to gratify the desire. It’s better to go right ahead and not
wait to be asked. Righteous people purse their lips and blush all over in
order to make a request; whoever spares them this travail multiplies the
good deed. [2.2] The words

“I ask” are vexing and burdensome, to be spoken with a downcast face. A
friend, or whomever you will make your friend by doing a good turn, must
be relieved of having to say them. However fast we move, we give too late if
we give on request.

[2.4] But there are many who drag their giving into hatefulness by the
harshness of their words and their arrogance, employing such speech and
such contempt that we regret obtaining our object. The thing is promised,
and then delays intervene. Nothing is more unpleasant than when what

deeds should be given and done on the spot; some find it’s harder to get
hold of them in fact than in promise. A third party must be sought to send a
reminder and a fourth to close the deal. Thus, a single gift gets worn away
as it passes through many hands. As a result, the one who made the promise
gets only a tiny portion of gratitude, since each intermediary takes a cut. If
you want your gifts to be appreciated, take care of this: that they pass whole
and undiminished to those to whom you’ve promised, without any
commission (so to speak) taken out.

[2.5] Nothing is so bitter as to be kept dangling a long time. Some can more
easily endure having their hopes dashed than having them drawn out at
length. Yet many share this fault— postponement of promises— through
their warped aspiration of having a huge crowd of petitioners. That’s 41

those who delight in long demonstrations of superiority; they think they
have less power if they don’t display that power to each person in turn, often

They do nothing promptly or conclusively; they harm at top speed but
benefit slowly.

[2.5.2] That’s where we get those shouts voiced by righteous anger: “Do it
already, if you’re doing anything!” and “Nothing is worth this; I’d rather you
said no!” When the heart, fatigued, begins to hate the good turn it waits for,
can it ever feel gratitude?

[2.5.4] All generosity is speedy. It’s natural to one who does something
gladly to do it quickly. Whoever gives aid slowly, dragging it out from one
day to the next, doesn’t give it from the heart. That person loses the two
greatest things, time, and the 43

Seneca often cites quips or anecdotes from historical figures to make his
points, as in the following passage, where he invokes Fabius Maximus (here
called Fabius Verrucosus), a hero of Rome’s wars against Carthage
(centuries before his own time).

[2.6.2] How sweet and precious is the gift given by one who won’t allow
any thanks, or who forgets, even as he gives, that he has given! But to carp
at a person just as you give something is madness; it mixes reproach with
kindness. Gifts and good deeds must not be made bitter or mixed with
anything unpleasant. Choose a different occasion if there’s anything you
want to reprove. Fabius Verrucosus used to compare a gift given in harsh
manner by a 45

Seneca’s ethical code demands that the giver abandon all thought of gain,
including, as explained in the following, any public acknowledgment of the

gift. Seneca would greatly approve the custom of modern day
philanthropists who have their gifts attributed to “anonymous.”

[2.10] Sometimes those being helped must even be deceived, so that they’re
not able to know from whom they benefited. It is said that Arcesilaus11
thought it best to give aid in secret to his friend, a poor man who concealed
his poverty, who was moreover ill but did not admit this either, who lacked
the means to pay for his needs. Arcesilaus snuck a small purse under the

“What? ” you ask. “He won’t know from whom he got it?” Yes, let him not

Then I’ll do much else, I’ll give much, so that from those other deeds he’ll
understand who did the first one. In the end, he won’t know he got
something, but I’ll know that I gave.

“That’s not enough,” you say. No, it’s not, if you plan to lend at interest. If
you plan to give, then you’ll give, in whatever way will most benefit the one
who receives.

honorable and more gracious, won’t you change your opinion? “I want him

Of course, when occasion allows, we must have regard for the joy that
comes from the eagerness of the recipient; I don’t deny that. But if our
assistance brings shame despite being called for, if our assistance offends
unless concealed, then I won’t publish my gift or good deed in the
newspapers.12 Of course not! I’m not going to let on that I was the giver.
It’s a teaching of prime importance and greatest necessity that I must not
make reproaches or even reminders. Between two partners in giving, there
is this law: The one should forget right away the giving of a gift, the other
should never forget receiving it.

keep saying, “I’m the one who saved you, I snatched you from doom!”? If I
remember it on my own account, it’s life you gave; if on yours, it’s death. I
owe you nothing, if you only saved me to have someone to show off. For
how long will you exhibit me? For how long will you prevent me from
forget-ting my bad luck? In a triumphal parade, I would only have marched

Wherever and whenever you described it!” Why do you need to speak of it,
to take over the other person’s job? There’s someone who can do this more
honorably, and whose narration will offer this new cause for praise: the fact
that you’re not narrating. You’re taking me for an ingrate if, in your eyes, no
one will know of your gift unless you tell them!

work. It takes lots of effort to bring what is sown into ripeness. Nothing
comes to fruition unless continuously cared for from its first stage to its last.
It’s the same with gifts and good deeds. Can there be among these anything
greater than the things a father gives to his children? Yet these lead nowhere
if they cease in infancy, if an enduring sense of duty does not nourish the
initial gift. Other gifts follow the same rule: If you don’t support them,
you’ll lose them. It’s not enough to have given; you must nurture them too.
If you want to make your debtors grateful, you must not only give but love
what you give as well.

Most of all, as I’ve said, let’s go easy on people’s ears. Reminders give rise
to irrita-tion; reproaches, to hatred. A superior attitude in giving must be
avoided above all.

“greatness” of haughty pride is an empty sham. It diverts onto the path of
hatred things that ought to be loved.

Some things though will cause harm to those who obtain them. In that case,
it’s a good deed not to give them, but indeed to refuse them. We will need to
assess what is useful for those who ask, rather than what is desired. Often,
we yearn for harmful things, and we’re not able to discern how dangerous
they are, since emotion gets in the way of judgment. But when yearning has
subsided, when that impulse of a soul on fire, which drives out better
counsel, has retreated, we hate those who sponsored our evil gifts and 61

Some gifts are smaller than ought to issue from great people, while others
are too large for the receiver. Compare the nature of both giver and receiver,
and assess too the gift you will give, asking whether it’s too large or too
small for the giver, and also whether the one on the receiving end will either
disdain it or refuse to accept it.

Alexander the Great— a madman, whose mind conceived only on an
enormous scale— was about to give a city to someone.

When the man to whom he was giving it took his own measure and rejected
the gift on the grounds that it would spur envy, saying it did not consort
with his station, Alexander replied: “I’m not asking what’s fitting for you to
get, but what’s fitting for me to give.” This seems to show spirit and royal
bearing, though in fact it’s very stupid. Nothing is in itself a fitting gift for

A Cynic wise man once asked King Antigonus for a talent of silver.16 The

denarius, the Cynic role in that of the talent; he might have given a denarius
to the man as a Cynic, and bestowed a talent in his own place as king.
Though some gifts might be too large for a Cynic to receive, there’s nothing
so small that the generosity of a king might not give it with honor.” If you
want my opinion, though, I approve the king’s replies.

It’s insupportable for someone who hates money to also ask for it. You’ve
proclaimed a hatred of money; this is your creed, you’ve adopted this role;

you must see it through.

It’s outrageous for you to get rich under a guise of noble poverty.17 One

catcher is at fault.

It stays on course when, as it passes through the hands of both, it’s skillfully
thrown and caught by both. But a good ballplayer must throw differently
depending on whether the other player is tall or short. It’s the same with
gifts and good deeds. Unless they’re fitted to both characters, that of the
giver and receiver, they won’t leave the hands of one, or arrive in those of

the other, as they should. If our exchange is with a skilled and trained
partner, we’ll throw the ball more boldly; however it travels, a skilled and
unencumbered hand will return it.

But if our partner is new to the game and un trained, we won’t throw so
stiffly or so strongly but more gently, running forward to direct the ball in a
relaxed way into his very hand. The same must be done in the 73

moneylender who makes harsh demands on clients gets a bad reputation, as
does the one who’s slow to accept payoffs and stubbornly finds reasons to
delay. But gifts are different; repaying them is just as crucial as not
demanding repayment. The best sort of person gives freely, never makes
demands, is delighted by returns, forgets what was given (honestly and
truly), and takes payback in the spirit of one accepting a gift.

Having covered many aspects of giving, Seneca turns also to the topic of
how one should receive gifts.

[2.18.1] Now let’s pass over to the other side of our topic—

namely, how people

ought to behave when they accept gifts or good deeds.

[2.18.2] The first lesson Reason offers is that we must not accept them from

plurima), grave tamen tormentum est debere, cui nolis; contra
iucundissimum ab eo accepisse beneficium, quem amare etiam post
iniuriam possis. [2.18.5] Itaque eligendum est, a quo beneficium accipiam;
et quidem diligentius quaerendus beneficii quam pecuniae creditor. Huic

everyone. From whom then? Let me reply in brief: from those to whom we
would have given. Let’s look carefully, for it takes greater discernment to
find a creditor than a borrower. Besides other problems (for many indeed
arise), it’s a serious torment to owe someone you don’t want to owe.

On the other hand, it’s most pleasant to accept a good turn from those
whom you’d be able to adore even after they did you wrong. [2.18.5] I need
to choose whom to receive a boon from, and I need to choose the lender of a
boon more carefully than a lender of money. To the moneylender I need
only pay back what I borrowed, and once I’ve done that, I’m free and clear.
But to the giver of a boon I must give back even more, and once I’ve done
so, we remain connected nonetheless.

[2.22] Once we’ve made the choice to accept, we should do so cheerfully,
expressing our joy in a way that the givers can’t miss, so they’ll get an

It’s a righteous source of happiness to see a friend made happy, and even
more righteous to have made him so. [2.23] But some prefer not to accept a
gift unless in secret; they avoid having anyone witness or know what’s going
on. These, you must know, have the wrong frame of mind. . . . Don’t accept
what you’re embarrassed to owe!

Some people give thanks on the sly, in a corner, whispering in the ear. This
isn’t shy-ness, but a kind of rejection. It’s ungrateful to give thanks only
after witnesses have left the room.

whole benefit stands newly before his eyes, what will he do after that initial
delight has grown cold? Some people accept haughtily, saying: “I don’t
need it, but since you’re so eager, I’ll go along with your wishes.” Others
accept passively, so as to leave the giver in doubt as to whether they even
perceived it. Still others barely open their mouths, behaving less gratefully
than if they’d just kept silent.

The intensity of our thanks should match the scale of the gift. Things like
this should be added: “You’ve made more people than you know beholden
to you” (for everyone rejoices in a benefit that is known far and wide); “You
don’t know what you’ve given me, but you ought to know how much more it
is than you imagine” (those who put themselves in debt show their gratitude

moved in the way we ought to be, our awareness will show in our faces.

Seneca is deeply concerned in On Benefits with ingratitude, a failing that,
he argues at one point, threatens the very fabric of society. He debates at
length (in a section not included here) whether ingratitude should be
considered a crime and punished accordingly, ultimately deciding it should
not be. In the following sections, he analyzes the causes of ingratitude, then
moves to a consideration of the gratitude we all owe, as human beings, to
Nature and to the gods.


## DE BENEFICIIS

[2.26] Videndum est nunc, quid maxime faciat ingratos. Facit aut nimius sui

## ON BENEFITS

[2.26] Now, we must examine what it is that mostly makes people
ungrateful. What makes them so is either too great regard for the self, and
the flaw entrenched in the mortal condition—

admiring oneself and

one’s deeds; or, greediness; or, jealousy.

Let’s begin with the first of these causes.

All people judge themselves generously.

That leads them to believe that they deserve everything, to accept gifts as
though receiving payments, and to consider their worth undervalued. “He
gave me this,” they say,

“but how tardily, after how many travails!

How much more I could have attained, had I preferred the patronage of him,
or him, or my own! I hadn’t looked for this: I’ve been tossed in with the
common herd. Does he think me worth so little? It would have been more

## honorable had I been ignored.”

Aeque ambitio non patitur quemquam in ea mensura honorum
conquiescere, quae quondam eius fuit impudens votum. Nemo agit de
tribunatu gratias, sed queritur, quod non est ad praeturam usque perductus;
nec haec grata est, si deest consulatus; ne hic quidem satiat, si unus est.
Ultra se cupiditas porrigit et felicitatem suam non intellegit, quia non, unde

## ON BENEFITS

[2.27.3] Second, it’s greed that prevents people from feeling grateful.
What’s been given never lives up to our wanton hopes.

We want more the more has come our way.

Greed becomes much more virulent when focused on collecting great
wealth, just as the strength of a flame becomes immea-surably fiercer, the
greater the blaze from which it leaps forth.

Similarly, ambition won’t let us rest content with our quantity of honors,
even if that amount meets what we once, im-modestly, wished for. We give
no thanks for a tribuneship, but instead complain that we weren’t advanced
to the praetorship; and this won’t do, if there’s no consulship; and not even a
consulship satisfies, if there’s only one.19 Greed keeps reaching ever
farther, not comprehending its own 89

[2.28] Then there’s jealousy, an evil more powerful and insistent than all
these. It deranges us with comparisons: “He gave to me, but gave more to
him, and gave sooner to him.” Jealousy never speaks on behalf of another,
but promotes its own cause ahead of all. How much simpler and more
sensible to mentally enlarge the gift that was received, on the understanding
that we are not valued as highly by others as by ourselves. “I should have
gotten more, but it wasn’t easy for him to give more; his generosity had to
be channeled in many directions; this is just a start, so let’s be of good cheer
and, by accepting this gratefully, let’s call forth his better nature; he did too

greater things if I complain, but rather, I’ll seem un deserving of what’s

rarely acts the judge! We complain every day that evil men are fortunate;
often a hailstorm passes over the garden plots of the worst sort of people,
and smashes the crops of the best; each of us endures our own destiny, in
friendship as in other things.” There’s no gift so generous that ill- will can’t
tear it down, and there’s none so tiny that a generous interpreter can’t make
it bigger.

You’ll never lack reasons to complain if you examine gifts with a jaundiced

because we’re lower than the gods, because we don’t stand on their level.
How much more gratifying to turn to the contemplation of so many and
such great gifts, and to give thanks, that the gods wanted us to have second
place to theirs in this most beautiful dwelling place, that they put us in
charge of the world! Is there any comparison between us and those animals
over which we have complete power? Whatever has been denied to us was
something that couldn’t be given.

Whoever you are who so unfairly assess the lot of humanity: Consider how
many gifts our parent20 has given us, how much more powerful than us are
the creatures we have put under the yoke, how much faster those we chase
and catch, how there’s nothing that lives that we can’t subdue with might.

so many crafts, and ultimately, the mind, which can journey to any place it
aims in a moment, which is swifter than the stars—

indeed it runs on ahead of the courses those stars will follow ages later; so
many fruits, so much wealth, such a store of other resources heaped up on
top of still others.

Go ahead, look around everywhere, take the individual attributes from all
creatures that you’d wish had been given to you; you won’t find anything
you’d rather be. If you rightly assess the kindness of Nature, you must admit
that you’re the apple of her eye.

Here’s the story: The immortal gods have held us most dear, and continue to
do so. They have made us closest in station to themselves, the greatest honor
that could be bestowed. We’ve gotten great things; we couldn’t manage
greater.

## ON BENEFITS

I thought this message was needed, both because I had to speak a bit about
the greatest benefits when discussing the smallest ones, and because the
arrogance of this hateful vice, ingratitude, spreads into other arenas. To
whom will those who scorn the highest gifts reply gratefully? What gift will
they consider great or needful of recompense? In whose debt will they be
for health or breath if they deny that their life is a gift from the gods, a gift
they requisition every day?

Whoever teaches people to be grateful helps the causes of both humans and
gods— the gods, who need nothing and who stand outside all desire, yet we
can still render them our thanks. There’s no reason for anyone to use
weakness or lack of resources to excuse an ungrateful mind, or to say:
“What am I to do, and how to do it?

When am I to return thanks to those higher beings, the lords of all things?”
It’s easy to return a good deed. If you’re greedy, you can do it without
expense; if you’re lazy, without effort: at the very instant you become
obligated, if you wish it, you’ll have paid back any donor on equal terms.

Whoever cheerfully accepts a gift or good deed, thereby returns it.

[2.33] Someone’s done me a good turn.

I received it just as he wanted me to do. So he’s got what he sought, the only
thing he sought, and so I’m grateful. Beyond this, he might get some
advantage from me, something useful that comes from a grateful person,
but this is not the remaining part of an incomplete duty— rather, it’s an
extension beyond what’s already complete.

If Phidias21 makes a statue, he gets one kind of profit from his art, another
from what 103

making it for profit. Phidias has completed his work even if he did not sell

[2.34] “What then?” you say. “Has a person who does nothing shown
gratitude?”

That person did the most important thing: With his good attitude he did me
a good turn, and did it on an equal footing, as befits friendship. Then too,
there’s the fact that a benefit and a loan are repaid differently.

There’s no need to expect me to display my repayment before you. The
thing takes place between our minds.

turn of events might make you ungrateful.

What I suggest is nothing difficult; I don’t want you to lose heart or grow
weary from anticipating great efforts and long ser-vitude. I’m not
postponing your task to the future; it’s about the here and now. You’ll never

debt, but so that your debt will be more free of worries.

In book 3, Seneca continues his discussion of ingratitude, what causes it
and how to combat it. After deciding it cannot be criminalized, he comes to
the conclusion that ingrates punish themselves by cutting themselves off
from the joy of generosity.

[3.1.3] Ingrates come in many varieties, just as thieves and murderers do;
they share one crime, but there’s a great range of types.

They’re ingrates if they deny that they got a gift; ingrates, if they conceal it;
ingrates, if they make no return; the worst ingrates of all, if they forget. The
ones who don’t repay at least still acknowledge the debt, and surely they
retain some trace of the good deeds done for them, buried within 109

their bad conscience; they might be turned back toward a show of gratitude
by some cause or other, if shame spurs them on or the sudden impulse
toward honorable behavior (the kind of thing that arises now and then even
in evil hearts), or if a ready opportunity beckons. But the other sort can
never become grateful, once the benefit they received has completely
slipped away.

Which would you call worse: the one who feels no gratitude for a good
deed, or the one who has no memory of it? It’s sickly eyes that shrink from
daylight, but blind ones that don’t perceive it. Not to love one’s parents is
impious, but to fail to recognize them— insane! [3.2.2] To repay a favor
requires moral strength, time, resources, and the blessings of Fortune. But
to remember it makes a person grateful enough, even without expense.

no effort, nor wealth, nor success, so those who don’t do it have no excuse
to hide behind.

[3.3] There are other factors that strip good deeds, sometimes even very
great ones, from our minds, but the foremost and most influential is that
we’re preoccupied by fresh desires and look to what we want, not what we
have. Reaching out for the next acquisition makes the one in your home
seem worthless. It follows that, if desire for new things makes what you’ve
gotten seem trivial, the one who helped you get it won’t be appreciated. We
adore and ad-mire our benefactors, and declare that our entire condition is
due to them, so long as the things we sought continue to please us.

But then, the dazzle of other things bursts into our hearts, and our impulses
rush toward them, in the way that people tend 113

to move from great desires to even greater ones. Whatever we earlier called
a gift or good deed gets immediately struck out of the record; we don’t look
at the things that set us above other people, but only at the display Fortune
makes in those who stand higher than we do.

No one can be both jealous and grateful at the same time. Jealousy belongs
to the bitter and discontented, gratitude to the joyous. Then too, there’s the
fact that all of us know only the moment that rushes past before us; only
rarely do we turn our minds backward toward the past. Thus, our teachers,
and the benefits they conferred, pass out of our minds once we have left
childhood behind; thus, the things that nurtured our adolescence die away,
for that stage of life never returns. We all file away that which was, not
under “past,” but under 115

The ill- tempered? The greedy? The reckless? The cruel? Do you really
think that qualities we detest go unpunished, or do you judge any
punishment more weighty than public hatred? This is punishment: not to
dare to accept a gift or good deed from anyone, not to dare to give one, to be
marked out by the eyes of all or to think oneself so marked out, to lose the
appre-hension of the best and sweetest thing. Or do you call someone
unhappy who’s lost keenness of sight, or whose ears are blocked by
infirmity, but not call wretched those who have lost the sensation of giving?

burns and chokes them. This punishment is great enough: not to taste the
fruit of what, as I’ve said, is sweetest of all.

In book 4 of On Benefits, Seneca moves to the moral heart of his topic, the
relationship between human generosity and the beneficence of the gods. As
a Stoic, Seneca subscribed to the view that the gods— not conceived of
primarily as Jupiter and his family, but as diffuse, amorphous beings or a
single collective being (see 4.7)— are entirely benevolent, to the extent (not
a very great one) they even care about human life. They are the forces that
first set the cosmos in order and continue to keep it running smoothly.
Because the world they have established holds many boons for 119

## DE BENEFICIIS

[4.1] Ex omnibus, quae tractavimus, Aebuti Liberalis, potest videri nihil

res expetendae sint.

Inveniuntur, qui honesta in mercedem colant quibusque non placeat virtus
gra-tuita; quae nihil habet in se magnificum, si quicquam venale. Quid enim
est turpius, quam aliquem computare, quanti vir bonus sit, cum virtus nec
lucro invitet nec absterreat damno. . . ? Calcatis ad illam utilitatibus eundum

## ON BENEFITS

humankind, Seneca regards them as models of selfless giving. This view is
partly based on his dismissal (see 4.25) of the traditional notion that the
gods delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices.

[4.1] Out of all the things we’ve taken up, Aebutius Liberalis, nothing can
be thought more essential or more needful of careful expression (as Sallust
says) than what is now before us: the question of whether giving a boon, and
returning a favor in turn, should be pursued simply for its own sake.

We see some people who attend to honorable things only for the sake of
gain, and who take no pleasure in virtue if it has no price tag— virtue,
which has no trace of magnificence if it’s something to be bought and sold.
What’s baser than for someone to count up how much a good man is worth,
since virtue neither draws us on with gain 121

expedience un-derfoot, and go wherever she calls or sends us, without
looking to our own household, without any sparing of our blood; her power
must never be disparaged. “What will I get then,” you say, “if I do this
bravely and graciously?” Only this: the fact that you did it. Nothing else is
promised to you.

[4.3.2] It’s not a gift or good deed if it looks toward an increase of fortune.
Besides, if only expedience prompted us to help others, then those who can
most easily do so would give least of all— the wealthy, the powerful, the
monarchs, those who don’t need help from others. Not even the gods would
bestow so many gifts, which in fact they heap on us day and night without
ceasing. For their own nature suffices for all their needs, and renders them
complete, 123

only reason for giving is to look out for oneself and one’s advantage. To
look not for where you can best place your boon, but where you will get the
most profit from it, and where you will most easily reap the reward— this is
not giving, but investing.

[4.4.3] Who is so wretched and cast down, who so accursed by fate and
born for trouble, as not to perceive the greatness of the generosity of the
gods? Look around at those whiners who are always bemoan-ing their
fortunes, and still you won’t find a one who has no share of heaven’s
benefac-tions, no one who has not been touched by a drop from that
kindliest of springs. Was it too little, then— that which was parceled out to

a certain power and achievement of heavenly things.

There can be as many names as the gifts that are bestowed.

[4.9] God gives us very many and very great gifts, without expectation of
repayment, since god does not need a gift from us, nor can we give anything
to god. Giving is something to be sought for its own sake.

All that is looked for in it is the gain of the one who receives. Let’s move
toward this, and put our own advantage aside.

“You claim,” someone objects, “that we must carefully select those for
whom we do good turns. . . . And what’s more, you ask where and in what
manner one ought to do them— something you would not need to ask, if
doing good turns was a thing to be sought for its own sake. It’s a good 137

honor for no other reason than for honor itself; yet, even if nothing else is
sought, we still ask, what we ought to do and when and in what way.

It’s these choices that constitute honor. Just so, when I choose for whom to
do a good deed, I am making sure that my deed is in fact good. For if it’s
done for some foul person, it’s neither a good deed nor an honor.

Returning a deposit is a thing to be sought for its own sake, yet I won’t
return it on every occasion, nor in any place or time. Sometimes it doesn’t
matter whether I withhold it or return it openly. I’ll look to the advantage of
the person to whom I’m going to return it, and I’ll deny that person any
deposit that will cause harm. I’ll do just the same with gifts and good deeds,
examining when, to whom, how, and why 139

I should give them. Nothing must be done unless by way of Reason. It’s not
a benefit if it’s not given by way of Reason, for Reason accompanies every
honorable deed.

How often have we heard this utterance from those condemning their own
heedless gift: “I’d rather have lost it than given it to them!” A heedless gift
is the most ignoble sort of loss; it’s much more serious to have given badly
than not to have gotten something back. The fault is another’s, if we get
nothing back, but our own, if we give to someone we didn’t choose
carefully. But in the choosing, I will look least of all to that which you
expect— namely, from whom I shall get a return. I’ll choose the one who’s
grateful, not the one who’ll give back. Often the one who won’t give back is
grateful, while the one who did so is an ingrate. My assessment aims at

still be grateful in the depths of need. Though all else be lacking, the quality

I don’t seek money, nor pleasure, nor glory from doing good turns. Content
to please one person, I’ll give for this reason: to do what I ought. But that
“ought” is still subject to choice. What sort of choice will it be, you ask? I’ll
choose sound people, straightforward, mindful, grateful; those who leave
alone what belongs to another, and keep a light grasp on what’s theirs; those
who wish others well. I’ll choose such people, and if Fortune grants them
nothing from which they might return the favor, the thing will be
accomplished— by their feelings.

If it’s advantage and base calculation that makes me generous, if I help no
one except to get that person to help me, then I won’t give to those who set
out for distant, diverse regions, since they’ll always be far off; I won’t give
to one who’s so ill as to have no hope of recovery; I won’t give when I myself am failing, when I don’t have the time to get my own back. But, so that
you’ll recognize the impulse to do good as a thing sought for its own sake:
We help those from foreign lands who’ve arrived in our ports and are soon
to depart again; we give, and fit out, a boat for the shipwrecked stranger, to
get him back home. He leaves scarcely knowing who sponsored his
recovery, and, though never to turn back again and come into our sight, he
appoints the gods as our debtors and prays that they return the favor on his

What then? When we have arrived at the very end of life, when we’re
setting out our last wills, do we not distribute gifts that will not help us in
any way? How much time is used up, how much thought do we take in
solitude over how much we should give, and to whom! But what does it
matter to whom we give, when we’ll get nothing back from anyone? Yet we
never give more carefully, never twist and turn our deci-sions, than when
honor alone stands before our eyes, all advantage stripped away. We are bad
judges of our duties, so long as hope distorts them, and fear, and that most
torpid of the vices, pleasure. When death has shut these out and has
dispatched an incorruptible judge to pronounce sentence, we seek those
most worthy to whom we 147

my riches to his.” If we don’t give except when we’ll get a return, then we’ll
have to die intestate!

[4.12.4] When you ask what return one gets from a gift or good deed, I will
reply:

“A good conscience.” What return comes from benefiting someone? Tell
me, what return comes from justice, from innocence, from greatness of
mind, from modesty, from self- restraint? If you seek something outside
these virtues, you do not seek these virtues. For what end does the world

just so, generosity is the duty of humanity. Why does one give? In order not
to fail to give, not to lose the chance of doing good.

[4.14] If you give a benefit in order to reap a reward, you didn’t give it. You
might as well claim that we give a benefit to animal stocks that we raise for
our food or for labor! Or that we benefit the fruit trees we tend, lest they
suffer from drought or from the hardness of dry, compacted soil! No one

mean, but humane, generous, and willing to give even when we’ve already
given, to increase prior gifts with new and fresh ones, having only this one
objective, how much good we will do for the person to whom we give . It’s
low and base, a thing without praise or renown, to do good because it’s
expedient. What greatness is there in loving oneself, being soft on oneself,
feathering one’s own nest?

The true desire to give calls us away from all those, lays its hand on us and
hauls us away toward loss, and gives up advantage for the very great joy of
simply doing good.

[4.17.2] Just as there’s no law that bids us love our parents or gratify our
children (for there’s no point in being pushed in the direction we were
already headed), just as no one has to be encouraged toward love 153

their own nature, and virtue is so gratifying that even wicked people
instinctively approve of better things. Is there anyone who would not wish to
seem beneficent, who would not cherish a reputation for goodness even
amid crimes and wrongs, who would not cloak in the semblance of rectitude
his most lawless deeds and appear to have helped those he has harmed?
Thus do people allow those whom they’ve destroyed to render thanks, and
they fake being good and generous because they can’t give in reality.

They wouldn’t do this unless love of honor, desirable for its own sake,
compelled them to cultivate a reputation contrary to their natures, to hide
their wickedness; they 155

No one has fallen so far away from the law of nature, or detached from
humanity, as to be evil from the heart. Pick anyone you want from among
those who live by rob-bery, and ask whether he’d rather get by decent
methods the things he pursues by theft and piracy. That man whose
occupation is to lie in wait and attack passers- by will want to find things
rather than steal them. You’ll meet no one who wouldn’t prefer to enjoy the
rewards of wickedness if he could do so without being wicked. We have
from nature this greatest award of all: Virtue casts its light into the souls of
all people, and those who do not follow it, see it nonetheless.

commanding us to be masters even of the sea. It has fended off onsets of

against sorrows; it makes us brave; we can call upon it as an aid against
Fortune. Take away Fellowship and you break the unity of the human race,

ourselves from, whatever utility it has outside itself. It’s helpful to be
grateful— yes, but I’ll do so even if it’s harmful. [4.20.3] It’s the ingrate
who looks to another bequest at the moment he pays back the first, who
anticipates while making return. I call them ingrates who sit beside a sick
man because he’s making out a will, who take the time to ponder the man’s
descendants and estate. Though they do all the things that good and dutiful

its own designs. Do you want to know this for certain, to know that it is not
corrupted by mere expedience? There are two kinds of grateful people.
Some are called grateful because they give something back in exchange for
what they received. These can make a display of generosity, perhaps; they
have something to boast of, to exhibit. Others who are called grateful have
received a gift with a good heart, and owe it in the same way, but keep their
gratitude sealed up in their conscience. What advantage can they 165

nothing more to show it. They love, they feel obligation, they want to return
the favor.

lack for nothing.

[4.21.3] Let’s say I want to return a favor.

I still have more to do beyond wanting, in order to be debt- free, whereas
there’s nothing more needed to be grateful. Often the one who does repay a
favor is an ingrate, and the one who doesn’t is the opposite.

Just as with all the other virtues, so this one can only be reckoned up with
reference to the heart. If the heart is dutiful, then Fortune is to blame for
anything that’s lacking.

People are grateful even if they only want to be so, and have no other

be cherished on that account. It holds yet more within itself; those who
count it among useful things don’t understand it very well. Is a person
grateful because it brings advantage? Will the gratitude be matched to the
scale of the advantage?

[4.25] We make it our goal to live in accord with Nature and to follow the
gods’ example. Yet what do the gods seek, in whatever they do, other than
simply the idea of doing 173

from the smoke of sacrifice and the scent of burning incense? See how they
toil every day, and how great the dole they provide; how many fruits they fill
the earth with, how opportunely they stir the seas with winds that bear us to
every shore, how heavy the sudden downpours with which they soften the
soil and refresh the dry roots of springs, renewing them by pouring
nourishment into their hidden sources. They do all this without recompense,
without any benefit to themselves. Let our way of life, too, keep to this
principle (if it does not swerve from its model): not to seek honorable things
for the sake of a salary. Let us feel shame if any gift or good deed has a
price. The gods, after all, are ours for free.

## ON BENEFITS

In the remaining three books of On Benefits , Seneca turns to specific
problems in the ethics of giving; the discussion becomes more casuistic and
less inspirational. It’s possible Seneca added these books at a later date
than the composition of the first four.

They are sampled less fully here.

The following passage strikes one of Seneca’s favorite themes (also sounded
in On Anger , an essay excerpted in an earlier volume for this series, How
to Keep Your Cool ): the idea that failings of human nature are universal,
and therefore our forgiveness for them should be universal as well. Then
Seneca moves swiftly to another of his central themes (explored in How to
Die , also in this series): the shadow cast by death on all human choices
and values.

[5.15] “If we follow your thinking,”

someone objects, “no one is ungrateful, 177

publica querella est perisse beneficia et paucissimos esse, qui de bene
merentibus non invicem pessime mereantur? [5.17.3] Ingrati publice sumus.
Se quisque interroget: nemo non aliquem queritur ingratum. Atqui non

just as, on the other hand, all are ungrateful.” Indeed— for as I’ve said, all
fools are wicked; whoever has one failing, has them all; all people are
foolish, and therefore wicked; so, all are also ungrateful.

What do I mean, you ask? Aren’t they so?

Doesn’t the indictment against the human race arise from all sides? Isn’t it a
source of public outrage that gifts and good deeds are squandered, and that
there are very few people who don’t return the worst sort of treatment to
those who have treated them well? [5.17.3] We are a nation of ingrates.

Let each do a personal inquiry: no one will fail to find an ingrate to
complain of. And it’s not possible that everyone would file this complaint,
unless everyone deserved to be complained of. So it follows that all are
ungrateful.


## DE BENEFICIIS

Ingrati sunt tantum? Et cupidi omnes et maligni omnes et timidi omnes, illi

Nolo te ad incerta revocare, ut dicam:

“Vide, quam ingrata sit iuventus! Quis non patris sui supremum diem, ut
innocens sit, optat? Ut moderatus sit, expectat? Ut pius, cogitat? Quotus
quisque uxoris optimae mortem timet, ut non et computet? Cui, rogo,

But are they only ungrateful?26 No, they’re all greedy, and spiteful, and
fearful (especially those who seem bold). Add this: they’re all ambitious and
irreverent. But there’s no cause to get angry. Forgive them, for they’re all
insane.

I don’t want to lead you into obscurities, so I say: “Look, how ungrateful
youth is! Who, though innocent, does not hope for his father’s last day; who,
though self-restrained, does not await that day, or think about it, though
dutiful? How much does each of us fear the death of a spouse, yet who does
not also reckon up the odds that it will happen? What defendant acquitted of
crime, I ask you, retains the memory of such a great boon beyond the very
next hour?”

Here’s something that’s widely acknowledged: Who dies without a
complaint?

## Who dares to say on his last day, “I’ve 181

life pro-testing and groaning? Yet to be dissatisfied with the time that has
passed is the mark of an ingrate. Your days will always be few if you count
them. Don’t think of your highest good as length of time. However much
you have, consider it a boon. Though your day of death be postponed, that
won’t advance your good fortune; your life won’t be happier for the delay,
just longer. How much better, in view of the pleasures you have reaped, not
to count up the years of others but to make a kindly assessment of your own,
and set them down as a profit!

“God judged me worthy of this much, and this much is enough. God might
have done more, but this alone is a gift.” Let’s be grateful toward the gods,
toward humankind, 183

Throughout his essays, Seneca summons the words of imagined critics, then
replies to them (prompting some ancient scribes to classify these works as
“dialogues”). In the following segment, Seneca returns to a distinction he
has already made, between gifts and loans, exploring it this time by
conversing with a fictitious speaker who claims Seneca has blurred those
two categories.

[5.20.6] Someone will say: “Why do you spend so much effort asking to
whom you should do a good turn, as though you were someday going to
seek repayment?” Some people think that repayment should never be asked.
They advance these reasons: “The unworthy will not repay even when
asked; the worthy will repay of their own accord.


## DE BENEFICIIS

corruperis creditum faciendo.”

[5.20.7] Verba sunt ista. Quam diu me nihil urguet, quam diu fortuna nihil
cogit, perdam potius beneficium quam repetam.

Sed si de salute liberorum agitur, si in periculum uxor deducitur, si patriae
salus ac libertas mittit me etiam, quo ire nollem, imperabo pudori meo et
testabor omnia me fecisse, ne opus esset mihi auxilio hominis ingrati;
novissime recipiendi beneficii necessitas repetendi verecundiam vincet.

Deinde, cum bono viro beneficium do, sic do tamquam numquam

Besides, if you give to a good person, be-ware lest you insult him by calling
in the chit, as though he had not been about to repay voluntarily. If you give
to a bad person, you’re the victim, but don’t ruin a gift by making it into a
loan.”

[5.20.7] Words, words, words. So long as I’m not in any way pressed, so
long as Fortune does not compel it, I’d rather count my good turn as a loss
than ask for it back.

But if there’s a question of my children’s health, if my wife is placed in any
danger, if the safety and freedom of my homeland sends me to where I don’t
want to go, I’ll master my shame and I’ll bear witness that I’ve done all I
can to avoid needing the help of an ungrateful person, but at last the need to
retrieve my good turn will conquer my embarrassment at asking for
payback. As I’ve said, when I give to a good person, I do 187

don’t even request so much as remind.

Will even the ultimate necessity drive me to approach someone with whom
I would need to have a long quarrel? Surely not. If anyone’s so ungrateful
that even a reminder is not enough, I’ll pass on by and regard as unworthy
the person who must be forced to be grateful.

[5.22] There are many who are in the dark both about denying and repaying
what they’ve received, who are not as good as the grateful nor as wicked as
the ingrates, who are merely slow and late— overdue loans rather than bad
debts. I won’t ask for payback from these, but I’ll remind them 189

right away:

“Forgive me; by Hercules, I didn’t know that you needed it, or I would have
brought it to you without prompting; I beg you not to think of me as
ungrateful. I remember well what you did for me.” Why would I hesitate to
make these people better than they were, both for my sake and their own?
Whomever I can prevent from doing wrong, I shall prevent, especially a
friend, both so that he doesn’t do wrong and, most of all, doesn’t wrong me.
I give him another gift if I stop him from becoming an ingrate.

What’s more, I won’t remonstrate harshly over what I did for him, but as
gently as I am able.

of gratitude is not dead, just asleep. Let’s wake it up.

In book 6, Seneca returns to the idea (already expressed in books 2 and 4)
that the gods are our models of generosity. This time, he gives the theme a
stronger astronomical focus, since the planets and other heavenly bodies
are, in his eyes, embodiments of the gods’ beneficence, if not gods
themselves.

He once again invokes an imaginary opponent to serve as his straw man—
someone who doesn’t believe that the sun and moon deserve our gratitude.
The argument against this person hinges on the question of whether these
heavenly bodies are truly benevolent— that is, whether they have a desire to
help humankind.

[6.19.5] A deed must be done on my account in order to put me under
obligation.

[6.21] “Sciam,” inquit, “solem ac lunam nobis velle prodesse, si nolle

“But if you think that way,” you say, “you owe nothing to the moon or the
sun; for they’re not set in motion on your account.”

But since they are set in motion in order to preserve the cosmos, they are
also set in motion for me— I’m a part of that cosmos.

Anyway, our condition and theirs is not the same. If someone helps me in
order that through me he may help himself, he has not done a good deed,
but only made me an implement of his own advantage. But the sun and
moon can’t help themselves through helping us, even if they do help us (for
their own reasons). For what help could we possibly give them?

[6.21] “I’d understand that the sun and moon want to help us,” you say, “if
they were able to not want that. But they can’t cease to be in motion. Here’s
my point: Let them stand still and take a break from their 195

seeing that, to look at the contrary case, no one seems to want as much as
the person whose will is so fixed as to be eternal? If someone wants who
can, in an instant, cease to want, doesn’t the one to whom “not wanting”
never occurs seem to truly want?

“Well alright, let them stop if they can,”

you say. This is what you’re saying: Let all those objects, separated by huge
distances and put in place for the care of the universe, desert their posts; let
stars smash into stars in a sudden confusion of matter, and with the harmony

all, then torpid night possess it, and let the deep abyss drain down this great
number of gods.

Is it worth the ruin of all this to show you that you’re wrong? These
heavenly objects do help you, even if you don’t want them to, and they stay
in motion for your sake, even if they started up for some other, greater sake.

will is everlasting and follows their own law. What they have established
does not change.

Whatever they can’t stop, they wanted to continue moving; they never have
regret for the plan they first contrived. Without doubt, they cannot stand
still, or withdraw to the opposite side, but the only reason is that their own
power holds them to their purpose; they remain steadfast, not through
feeble-ness but because it does not please them to stray from perfection, and
because it was established that they move thus. What’s more, in that first
dispensation, when they set out the stuff of the cosmos, they had regard even
for our lot, and took account of humanity. Thus, they can’t be seen to run
through the skies and unfold their work solely for their own sake, since we
too are a part of that work.

didn’t merely stumble on a gift bestowed by ignorant beings. They knew we
would receive the things we’ve received; and though their purpose is
grander than mere preservation of the mortal sphere, and the reward of their
action is greater as well, yet their mind was extended toward our advantage

We’re not such a trivial creation that we could have simply dropped out of
her. Just look at how much scope we are given, and how human power
extends far beyond the human realm. Look at how widely Nature allows our
bodies to travel, not stopping them at the boundaries of lands but send-ing
them into every part of herself. Look at the great daring of our minds, how
these alone come either to know the gods or to seek them, and to join with

What madness then to dispute with the gods over whether we’ve been given
a gift! How can we ever show gratitude to those who can be thanked only by
outlay of expense, if we deny that we’ve had the generosity of the beings
who’ve been most generous to us, and who will both continue to give and
will never get anything back?27

How bad a flaw is ingratitude? The closing segment of On Benefits shows
Seneca once again contemplating this question, this time in a more
charitable frame of mind than in books 2, 3, and 4. He here relies on his
notion of the universal sinfulness of humankind to argue that ingrates, like
other sinners, 207

deserve forgiveness and kind treatment. He illustrates this notion with a
vivid analogy, comparing humanity to a rampaging army sacking a
conquered city. In that chaos of greed and violence, who can be expected to
act well?

The point Seneca wants to establish is that only by accepting ingratitude
can we continue to be generous (which is to say, virtuous) beings. We must
never allow our disappointment in those who receive to stop us from giving.

[7.26] You ask the most essential question of all, one fitting for the closing
section of this essay: How are we to treat the ungrateful? I say: With a
tranquil, calm, and noble mind.

However ungrateful, thoughtless, and inhuman the ones who offend you,
don’t ever regret your decision to give. Never let outrage push you into

required deters some from gratitude; expense, others; danger, others; still
others, a contemptible embarrassment, an unwillingness to admit, by giving
back, that they have received; others, ignorance of duty; others, laziness;
still others, a busy schedule.

Look here! how the vast desires of humanity always grasp and demand; you
won’t be surprised then if no one gives back, since no one gets enough.

unstable of passions, do you really seek faithfulness, the most stable thing of
all?

[7.27] If a true picture of human life should come into your thoughts, you’ll
think you see the image of a city just captured. All regard for shame and
right has been lost; violence is in charge, as though the signal had been
given to throw everything into chaos.

Fire and sword hold sway; crime is released from restraint of law; not even
religion, normally a shield for suppliants even amid enemy weapons,
restrains those rushing to seize booty. Plunderers assault the private and the
public, the sacred and profane; they break down doors and leap over walls,
or, not content with a narrow entrance, hurl down whatever blocks them and
reach for riches over the ruins. One man despoils but does not kill; another
carries off his booty 215

## DE BENEFICIIS

In hac aviditate generis humani o ne tu nimis fortunae communis oblitus es,

Est istuc grave vitium, est intolerabile et quod dissociet homines, quod
concordiam, qua imbecillitas nostra fulcitur, scindat ac dissipet, sed usque
eo vulgare est, ut illud ne qui queritur quidem effugerit.

Cogita tecum, an, quibuscumque debuisti, gratiam rettuleris, an nullum
umquam apud te perierit officium, an omnium te beneficiorum memoria

comitetur. Videbis, quae puero data sunt, ante adulescentiam elapsa, quae in
iuvenem conlata sunt, non perdu-rasse in senectutem. Quaedam perdidimus,

someone else.

You there! Too forgetful of our common lot, amid this greed of the human
race— if, that is, you’re looking amid the city- sackers for someone to give
something back. If you feel outrage that there are ingrates, feel it also for the
overindulgent, the greedy, the unchaste. . . . Ingratitude is a serious failing,
beyond endurance; it dissolves human bonds, breaks up and destroys the
harmony by which our frailty is protected. Yet it’s so common that even
those who complain of it don’t escape it.

Take stock with yourself. Have you returned a favor to those you owed? Has
no service ever been lost on you? Does the memory of all your benefits stay
with you for all time? You’ll discover that things given in childhood slipped
away before 217

lose, others we toss out, some disappear little by little from our gaze, from
others we turn away our eyes. [7.28.2] You might find in your own heart, if
you search yourself thoroughly, the fault you complain of.

You’re unjust if you’re angry at a general offense, foolish, if at your own;
give pardon and you’ll be pardoned. You’ll make others better by bearing
with them, worse, by your reproach. There’s no reason to furrow their
brows; let them save face, however much face they have left. Often the tooloud voice of a carping critic shat-ters a shaky set of scruples. We don’t fear
to be what we seem. It’s the one who’s been found out who loses the sense
of shame.28

have 219

things, even if it spurs a bad response. “He’s not the sort we thought he
was”; but we should remain the sort we are, very different from him.

Your loss only came to light at this moment; it happened long before. The
ingrate brings shame on us when revealed, for we can’t make an issue of the
lost gift without flag-ging the fact it was badly given. As much as we can,
let’s plead his case in our own minds: “Perhaps he couldn’t, perhaps he
didn’t realize, perhaps he’s still going to do it.” A patient and wise creditor
sometimes collects on delinquent accounts by keeping them open and
helping them by postponement. We must do likewise.29 Let’s nurture the
sense of trust when it grows weary.

clear. Even when things seem to be lost, an attitude of restraint does the
most good. Handicaps of the mind, like those of the body, have to be dealt
with gently. Often what you might have untangled with perseverance gets
snapped off by a rash pull.30 What need is there of curses, of complaints, of
abuse?

Why release those you’ve helped, and set them free? I answer: If they’re
ungrateful, so what? They owe you nothing. What’s the point in estranging
those for whom you’ve done great things, so that you’ll make a sometime
friend into a full- time enemy?

So that they’ll seek their own protection by way of our disrepute? So that
this will be heard: “I can’t figure out why he couldn’t put up with the one he
owed so much to; there’s something going on”? Everyone 223

love good people even while wronging them—

people to whom he owes this new debt, that he is not penalized for
nonpayment.

and rest, that we escape the chaos of eternal night (not plunged into
darkness); the sun that moderates the seasons with its course through the

benignly, the error of our inconstant souls.

Let’s do as they do. Let’s give, even if much that we give ends up useless.
Let’s give to others nonetheless; let’s give even to those who caused our
losses. Collapse never stopped anyone from raising up houses, and, when
fire has consumed everything, down to the shrines of the gods, we lay
foundations on the still- smoldering ground and commit new cities to the
same soil where others sank. That’s how stubbornly the heart clings to good

unsuccessfully at first.

“So they’re ungrateful; they didn’t hurt me, but themselves. As for me, I got
the reward of my gift when I gave it. I won’t be slower to give as a result of
this, but more selective. What I squandered on them, I’ll get back from
others. But even to them I’ll give once again, and, like a good farmer, I’ll
overcome the sterile soil with care and cultivation. My gift is lost to me, but
they are lost to humanity. It’s not the sign of a great soul to give a gift and
lose it, but rather to lose it— and then give.”

With those words, On Benefits comes to a close. But Seneca again took up
the topic of giving and receiving in one of his Moral Epistles , a set of open
letters on various 231

topics, composed near the end of his life.

What follows is the last portion of Epistle 81 , a letter that expands on many
of the ideas discussed in On Benefits (and indeed is characterized by
Seneca as a sequel to that work).


## EPISTULAE MORALES LXXXI

[19] Omnia facienda sunt, ut quam gratis-simi simus. Nostrum enim hoc
bonum est, quemadmodum iustitia non est, ut vulgo creditur, ad alios
pertinens; magna pars eius in se redit. Nemo non, cum alteri prodest, sibi
profuit, non eo nomine dico, quod volet adiuvare adiutus, protegere
defensus, quod bonum exemplum circuitu ad facientem revertitur, sicut mala
exempla reddunt in auctores nec ulla miseratio contingit iis, qui patiuntur
iniurias, quas posse fieri faciendo docuerunt, sed quod virtutum omnium
pretium in ipsis est. Non enim exercentur ad praemium; recte facti fecisse
merces est.


## EPISTLE 81

[19] We should do all we can to be extremely grateful. For this virtue is
entirely in our power, in a way justice is not (though it’s generally assumed
to be so), for justice depends on others, while the great part of gratitude
returns upon itself. Everyone helps themselves when they help another—

not, I say, because the one helped will want to help them, or the one
defended will protect them, or because a good model of behavior comes
back around to those who set it (in the way that bad models rebound back
upon those who set them, and those who suffer wrongs they themselves
have 235

EPISTULAE MORALES LXXXI Gratus sum, non ut alius mihi libentius
praestet priore irritatus exemplo, sed ut rem iucundissimam ac

beneficium non aliter quam per speciem iniuriae potero, aequissimo animo
ad honestum consilium per mediam infa-miam tendam. Nemo mihi videtur
pluris aestimare virtutem, nemo illi magis esse devotus quam qui boni viri
famam perdidit, ne conscientiam perderet. Itaque, ut dixi, maiori tuo quam

proven possible— by doing them— receive no sympathy), but because the
reward of all virtues is in the virtues themselves. They are not practiced

according to a price chart.

The payment for having done a virtuous deed is that you have done it.

I’m grateful, not in order that someone else, stirred by my example, will
more willingly give to me, but in order to do a very gratifying and beautiful
thing. I’m grateful not because it’s useful but because it’s pleasing.
Understand that this is so by the following: If it’s not possible to be grateful
except by appearing un grateful, if I can’t repay a benefit except by the
appearance of doing harm, I will, with the most composed mind, steer
toward an honorable goal even though I cross through the midst of illrepute. No one, it seems to me, more highly prizes virtue, no one seems
more 237

virtus beatos, gratum autem esse virtus est, rem usitatam reddidisti,

divinum fortunatumque non pervenit.

Contrarium autem huic affectum summa infelicitas urget. Nemo sibi gratus
est qui alteri non fuit. Hoc me putas dicere, qui ingratus est miser erit? Non
differo illum: statim miser est.

Itaque ingrati esse vitemus, non aliena causa, sed nostra. Minimum ex

committed to it than the one who loses the reputation of being a good
person in order not to lose a good conscience. So it is that, as I said, you’re
grateful more for the sake of your own good than that of another. That other
person encounters something common and banal: getting back what he had

given. Whereas you encounter a great thing, proceeding from the most
blessed condition of the heart: gratitude. For if moral evil makes people
unhappy, and virtue makes them happy, and to be grateful is a virtue, then
you’ve made return of an ordinary thing but obtained an invaluable one: the
consciousness of gratitude, which enters only into the divine and blessed
mind.

The depths of unhappiness attend the opposite impulse, ingratitude. No one
is grateful to himself if he has not been grateful to another. Do you think I
mean this: 239

EPISTULAE MORALES LXXXI quemadmodum Attalus noster dicere
sole-bat: “Malitia ipsa maximam partem veneni sui bibit.” Illud venenum
quod serpentes in alienam perniciem proferunt, sine sua continent, non est
huic simile; hoc haben-tibus pessimum est. Torquet ingratus se et macerat;
odit, quae accepit, quia redditurus est, et extenuat, iniurias vero dilatat atque
auget. Quid autem eo miserius, cui beneficia excidunt, haerent iniuriae?

At contra sapientia exornat omne beneficium ac sibi ipsa commendat et se
adsidua eius commemoratione delectat. Malis una voluptas est et haec
brevis, dum acci-piunt beneficia, ex quibus sapienti longum gaudium manet
ac perenne. Non enim illum accipere, sed accepisse delectat, quod 240

that the ingrate will later be wretched? No, I don’t grant a postponement:
he’s wretched right now.

Therefore, let’s avoid ingratitude, not for another’s sake but for our own.
Only the smallest and most trivial part of wickedness redounds on other
people; the worst and, as I might say, densest part of it stays at home and
weighs on the one who owns it, just as our Attalus used to say: “Moral evil
drinks the greater portion of its own poison.” But the poison we’re

discussing is not like the one used by snakes, harmful to others yet causing
no harm to the snake; this one is most damaging to those who possess it.
The ingrate tortures and lashes himself; he hates what he has received
because he will have to repay it, and in his mind he diminishes the gift
while expanding and increasing the injuries he has received. What’s more


EPISTULAE MORALES LXXXI inmortale est et adsiduum. Illa

## EPISTLE 81

wretched than a person to whom injuries cling while gifts and good deeds
fall away?

But wisdom, on the other hand, lends beauty to every gift, commits it to her
own care, and delights in constant recollection of it. Evil people get only a
single pleasure, and it’s a brief one, lasting only as long as they’re receiving
the gifts. For the sage, a long and lasting joy, arising from these gifts,
remains firm. He delights not in getting but in having gotten, an immortal
and unceasing thing. He shows disdain for the things that have wounded
him, and forgets them, not out of negligence but intentionally. He doesn’t
look at the downside of everything nor seek to assign blame, but rather
attributes people’s faults to their bad luck. He doesn’t take amiss the words
he hears or the looks he gets, but makes light of whatever went wrong by a
kindly interpretation.

that excite the mob. If you want to show gratitude, you must go into exile,
shed blood, endure poverty, and have your very innocence frequently
stained and subjected to unworthy rumors. It costs not a little for a grateful
man to stay true to himself.

We think nothing more dear than a gift or good deed while we are seeking
it, and nothing more worthless after we’ve obtained it. You ask what it is
that makes us forgetful of what we’ve gotten? The desire of getting more.
We hold in mind not what’s been attained but what we still need to ask for.
Riches, political offices, power, and other things that seem dear in public

opinion, but are worthless when valued for their own sake, drag us away

but their inner nature. Those things I mentioned have nothing grand that
should draw our thoughts to them, except this: We are used to being dazzled
by them. They are not praised because they’re desirable but desired because
they’re praised. Our individual errors of judgment lead to a mass error, and
that mass error creates further errors in individuals.

But just as we’ve believed those ideas in the past, let’s now trust the same
people on this: Nothing is more honorable than a grateful heart. All the
cities of the world join in proclaiming this, even all the peoples who live in
barbarian lands. The good and the wicked agree on this. Some there will be
who praise pleasure, others who prefer hard work; some will call pain the

wealth among the highest goods, another will say it was discovered only to
become a bane to human life, and that nothing is wealthier than the person
to whom Fortune finds nothing she can give. Amid this great diversity of
values, all people will affirm to you, as it were with a single voice, that
gratitude must be shown to those who have done good deeds. The
argumentative mob will agree on this, while, in the meantime, we continue
to return injuries instead of benefits, and the principal cause of ingratitude is
that it’s impossible to be grateful enough.

Our madness has reached this extreme: It’s become a very dangerous thing
to bestow great benefits on someone, since if the recipient thinks it’s
shameful not to repay, he’ll want no one around to whom 249

EPISTULAE MORALES LXXXI Eo perductus est furor, ut periculosissima

1. Book, chapter, and (sometimes) section numbers given in this edition

enable readers to reference the Latin text. They also provide a guide to my
excerptions; a new number appears wherever a stretch of text has been
skipped in the move to a new selection. The use of a section number (for
example, the “9” in “1.1.9”) indicates that the selection begins in the middle
of a chapter of Seneca’s text.

## 2. The Latin word animus, often rendered

“mind,” is here often translated “heart”

because Seneca uses it to refer to the seat of emotions as well as of
thoughts.

3. Throughout this essay, Seneca contrasts the moral dimensions of giving

with those 253

of lending or conducting business transac-tions; usually he differentiates the
two, but here, in this first comparison, he stresses a point that they ought to
share in common.

4. Throughout his essays, Seneca pauses to allow an unnamed person to

voice dissent, sometimes introducing this person as “you,”

at other times “he,” at still other times

“someone,” or, as in this passage, offering no introduction at all. Seneca
immediately launches into his counterargument as soon as this objector has
had a say.

5. Seneca here verbally transforms beneficium, normally thought of as the

thing given, into the act of giving; the “gift” is only a by- product.

6. A line quoted, with slight adaptation, from Vergil’s Georgics (4.132).

7. During the civil wars that plagued the Roman state in the century before

Seneca’s, strongmen used proscription as a way 254

## NOTES

## to eliminate enemies. Someone who was proscribed—

that is, posted on a public

blacklist— could be killed by any citizen in exchange for a reward.

8. The sexism of this sentence has been allowed to stand, though of course

Seneca’s contemporaries would find nothing objec-tionable in it.

9. Employed in hunting wild game.

10. Seneca speaks as one who knows, since he was serving as Nero’s chief

minister during the time this work was written.

11. A Greek philosopher of the third century BC.

12. “Newspapers” is a mild anachronism, but the acta diurna that Seneca

here refers to— placards put up each day in the Roman forum— served
more or less the same purpose.

13. On proscription, see note 7. The men of the so- called Second

used this method to solidify

their control of Rome in the wars following Julius Caesar’s assassination.

14. Seneca compares the donor’s exhibition of the beneficiary to a

conquering general’s display of prisoners in a triumphal proces-sion
through the streets of Rome.

15. Romans of high status could obtain snow for cooling their drinks; this

was brought down from the high mountain slopes by runners.

16. There were two kings named Antigonus in Hellenistic Greece, both

fabulously wealthy; the story told here might concern either. A talent of
silver contained 6,000

drachmas, a very large sum. Cynic philosophers disdained money and went
about in ragged cloaks, begging from passers- by.

The denarius mentioned in the following is a Roman coin of small value.


## NOTES

17. A risky sentiment for Seneca, who often adopted a Cynic pose in his

disdain for wealth, yet accrued one of the greatest fortunes of his time.

18. Chrysippus, a Greek philosopher of the Stoic school, is here called

“our,” since Seneca and his fellow Stoics considered him a kindred spirit.

19. These coveted political offices are here mentioned in ascending order.

20. Meaning, perhaps, the gods conceived as a collective. The word parens

used here can be feminine, but Seneca gives it masculine gender.

21. The great sculptor and architect of classical Athens, responsible for

much of the Parthenon.

22. It’s not uncommon for Seneca (or other ancient authors) to speak of

“god” ( deus) in the singular, though of course he believed 257

## NOTES

that this unified divine mind was manifested in a plurality of beings.

23. Elaborately decorated ceilings were a mark of high luxury in Seneca’s

day.

24. This line (and several others omitted here) is quoted from Vergil’s first

Georgic, where the “god” referred to is in fact Augustus Caesar.

## 25. Here and in the following, “fellowship”

very imperfectly translates Latin societas, a word of far larger scope. When
used by philosophic authors like Seneca, societas denotes the human
impulse for aggregation and communal life.

26. I follow here the emended text of M. C.

Gertz, who inserted a second iteration of ingrati sunt.

27. A difficult sentence. Seneca’s point is that gratitude must begin with

piety, for if we can’t feel grateful toward the gods, with 258

## NOTES

their perfect generosity, we’ll never feel grateful toward our fellow human
beings (“those who can be thanked only by outlay of expense”).

28. The train of thought is difficult, but amounts to: Let’s overlook

ingratitude, for if we treat others as though they were grateful, they’re more
likely to become so.

29. Elsewhere Seneca takes pains to distinguish giving from lending, but

here he establishes a parallel.

30. The metaphor is of a snarled piece of thread. Following M. Haupt’s

emendation, I have here adopted the insertion of the word violentia into the
text.

31. An interesting glimpse of the perils of social relations among the

Roman elite: Seneca speculates that someone who owes a debt to a highstatus benefactor, if pressed too hard, might spread evil rumors as a way to


## NOTES

take revenge or avoid payment. At the end of his Epistle 81 (see the
following chapter), he even implies that the debtor might have his creditor
killed.
